He was created byRickby combining the DNA ofAbraham LincolnandAdolf Hitlerin an attempt to create a morally neutral super leader. He failed and the end result was a cognitively dissonant and morally confused emotional train wreck. Abrodolph Lincoler appears at a party Rick andSummerhosted, seeking revenge against his creator. Due to a miscommunication, Abrodolph Lincoler engages in a losing fist-fight withBrad. During their search forKalaxian Crystals,MortyandNancy, accompanied by Lincoler, are ambushed and attacked by an alien creature. Lincoler valiantly fights off the monster, but is heavily wounded in the process. He passes his seemingly last words along through Morty, revealing that he only wanted to be accepted by his creator, Rick. At the end of \"Ricksy Business\" it is revealed that Lincoler survives the ordeal. He utters \"Revenge...\", and is subsequently picked up and used as a sex toy for theTesticle Monstersthat inhabit the planets' surface. Abrodolph Lincoler is a genetically engineered human clone of fairly large stature. He is a combination of Abraham Lincoln and Adolf Hitler. He is a man with the top hat and beard of Abraham Lincoln, as well as the hair, mustache, and army fatigues of Adolf Hitler. Additionally, he wears an article of clothing that resembles a high-tech flak jacket or bulletproof vest. Abrodolph Lincoler is described as a crazed maniac, who is a cognitively dissonant and morally confused emotional train wreck. He speaks at length about the duality of his existence. While he initially appears to be a tough foe, he is easily beat up byBrad, later though being able to fight off a beast somehow. It can be deduced that this was due to his guard being down, or that he didn't want the party-goers to think that he was indeed a racist by fighting back against Brad. His personal views are a hodgepodge of Lincoln's and Hitler's. For example, while he believes in the emancipation of African-Americans, he also believes in the eradication of 'inferior genes'. He is neither entirely evil nor good."

After they left, Albert quickly got back up and angrily said to himself that from that point on, he will mess with time.

Characterized by a superiority complex and abandonment issues, Beth gradually came to struggle with her husband over his contributions to their marriage, due in part to his lower-level position and subsequent employment, further driven by her father influencing her feelings of superiority. The two eventually divorced, before reuniting in theSeason 3 finale. Around the same time, Beth grappled with the decision to leave her family in order to find herself or stay on Earth and accept things for the way they are. She ended up leaving Rick to decide for her, who created a clone of Beth and mixed the two around so not even he would know which one was the original Beth. One of the Beths flew out into space, whilst the other remained on Earth beside her family. The details of Beth's history are relatively unknown; she was born fromRick SanchezandDiane Sanchez, and she has recounted herself as a \"bright-eyed\" woman from Muskegon, Michigan in \"Meeseeks and Destroy.\" At some point during her childhood, her parents' marriage deteriorated amid unknown circumstances, and her father left her mother. Beth blamed herself for her parents falling out, and seeing her father as an intelligent scientist compared to her mother, Beth came to idolize Rick and blamed Diane for \"chasing off the dad with the guts to leave\"."

She only roars and growls throughout most of the episode, but when she is creating her army of Jerry Mythologs, she speaks to Beth in a lower, more guttural version of Beth's voice. Being based on how Jerry views Beth, Beth's Mytholog is a highly exaggerated parody of Beth: a strong and cunning, yet caustic and cold-hearted beast with a massive ego and lust for power and control. She describes herself asthe strongest, smartest being alive, simply because Jerry thinks Beth as being that much stronger and smarter than she really is. Mytholog Beth is also highly intelligent, immediately seeing the usefulness in Mytholog Jerry's unwavering subservience and shapeshifting abilities, which she uses to quickly evade detection and escape from her cell before destroying and taking over the facility on Nuptia 4."

Despite his hope to be rid of Rick once and for all, he finds himself dragged into Rick C-137 and Morty Prime's circle of influence, reluctantly cooperating with them as they face off against the bigger existential threat ofRick Primeand theOmega Device. As revealed in \"Unmortricken\", Evil Morty was once another Morty, constantly mistreated and dragged on adventures. One day, he grew fed up withhis Rickand got him blackout drunk while he engineered a device that would allow him to control Rick, to be hidden underneath a black eyepatch. His resentment towards Rick caused him to become interested in the concept of theCentral Finite Curve, and he schemed to gain access to the means to escape it."

Rick stopped him and Arthricia explained that she stole his ship because she wanted to kill the descendents of the rich people who came up with the idea of the purge and forced society to comply with it thousands of years before that day, for keeping the tradition in place. Rick helped Arthricia by giving her one of the war suits and they both broke into the mansion where the rich people lived and slaughtered them all."

However, unlike most other of her counterparts, this Beth has aborted the fetus, which growing up would become her daughter Summer, and having never married, not even her son Morty was never born. She and Jerry split up after this with Jerry most likely studying to become an actor and Beth going to medical school. Beth graduated medical school and became a surgeon at some hospital, but did not end up finding a new romantic partner, instead drowning her sorrows in wine and surrounding herself with exotic birds in her house. Beth holds the same looks as other Beths with shoulder-length blond hair, and pale skin. She dresses herself in a red collar shirt and blue pants when she's not at work. Beth is a successful lonely woman living on her own. She fights her loneliness by surrounding herself with a lot of exotic birds in cages. She has also inherited her father's alcoholic tendencies with drinking herself drunk on wine on a daily basis. This is also to cope with her loneliness, which came as a result of her sacrificing everything to become a surgeon. She is also clearly intelligent as she did become a surgeon."

Morty isRick Sanchez's grandson and is often forced to tag along on his various misadventures as a sidekick whilst attendingHarry Herpson High Schoolalong with his sister,Summer.[9]At the beginning of the series, Morty was shown to be an incredibly anxious and submissive teenage boy. He had little say in the adventures he went on with Rick and was often verbally abused and manipulated by him. However, Morty eventually gained more confidence as time went on and is now more capable and independent rather than a mere sidekick. This newfound confidence also allowed Morty to distance himself from Rick more often due to his despicable tendencies, although Morty still stays by his side when necessary. It has since been revealed in \"Solaricks\" that Rick (C-137) is not his true grandfather, as protagonist Morty is actually the biological grandson ofRick Prime, a version of Rick who murdered C-137's family. After decades of failing to get revenge on Rick Prime, Rick eventually arrived in Morty's dimension to take his place[10], kickstarting the series and thus Rick and Morty's adventures. Morty, despite being fourteen, has a mental age of several lifetimes. This is due to living in a time freeze for six months along with Rick and Summer[11][12], playing fifty-five years inside of the arcade gameRoy: A Life Well Lived[13](the game is designed to cause memory blur after a play session, meaning Morty only has a vague recollection of this life), living for several more months inside of theTeenyverse[14], an especially long video-game like reality save[15], and growing up for several decades as part of a manifestation inside of the Fear Hole[16](the Fear Hole as an entity is also designed to cause memory blur related to an individual's experiences within it)."

The Smith family is enjoying delicious spaghetti for family dinner but Morty uncovers the truth about the dish leading to a horrifying discovery and the collapse of a society. TheSmith Familyenjoys bowls of delicious spaghetti bolognese supposedly made for them byRickevery Thursday. Unfortunately, as tends to be the case with situations involving Rick, there is a twist:Mortylearns that the spaghetti comes from dead bodies. Specifically, bodies from a planet where people who kill themselves turn into spaghetti – more specifically, the best spaghetti in the universe. Morty finds the whole situation morally reprehensible and immediately confesses to the situation at a funeral for one of the people they ate, against Rick's protests. He also tells his family, though he is annoyed when they are more disappointed at the loss of their spaghetti nights than the fact they were eating people. The president of Spaghetti Planet contacts Morty after hearing about the funeral confession and offers Morty some \"ethically-sourced\" spaghetti, from a sickly person who sought assisted suicide and accepted their fate as food. Morty finds the idea that he is eating someone who wanted to become food more palatable, and he and the family return to their old spaghetti nights. However, Rick reveals the planet turned making spaghetti into a full industry, selling cans of \"MortyO's Suicide Spaghetti\" across the galaxy. Morty proposes this is still ethical upon noticing the cans have messages from the people the spaghetti came from, until Rick brings him back to Spaghetti Planet and reveals the government have resorted to encouraging depression in the people in order to keep up with the demand. The president of Spaghetti Planet protests that they need to keep the spaghetti trade open or else it will destroy the global economy, which could prove much more destructive. Morty reluctantly asks Rick for assistance to solve the issue, promising to do what Rick wants (for only two weeks). Rick's initial attempt to create sentient clones programmed to kill themselves fails when the clones resort to drastic measures to avoid becoming food; his further attempts at creating less-sentient beings also leave something to be desired, with his most promising result being a torso that is physically unable to do anything, much less kill itself. They eventually solve the problem when Morty suggests giving it a functioning arm. At first, spaghetti production returns with these torsos, only for everyone to find some fault in this: a group of alien consumers claim it tastes terrible and demand real spaghetti, and a group of planet inhabitants still claim it is unethical and claim torso rights (and both end up suicide-bombing the factory due to arguing over which should go first)."

When Beth begins to express doubts, Space Beth admits to the affair in front of Jerry, who promptly rolls up into a pillbug (a protocol Rick built into him that he’d forgotten about). Rick reveals that Jerry can only emerge from the pillbug by his own choice, and trying to force him out will only make things worse.

Jerry, overhearing this, leaves the shell and declares he won’t let them lobotomize themselves over him, but says he is still leaving Beth. Eventually, it emerges that Jerry is more upset that the two Beths hooked up behind his back than the fact they did it and he actually quite enjoys being cuckolded. As Rick, Morty, and Summer uncomfortably listen from the dining room table, Jerry and the two Beths have an increasingly sexual conversation that culminates in all three of them hooking up.

Beth realizes this means that Tommy might actually still be trapped in there and enters the realm with Rick. As Beth argues with Rick about spending her childhood in the \"glorified chicken coop\" instead of by his side, Rick is captured and nearly fed to the offspring of a giant bird-like creature, losing an arm in the process. After fighting off the bird and her babies using a new mechanical arm, Rick and Beth discover that the lifeforms have been created and corrupted using human DNA, indicating that Tommy is indeed still trapped in the dimension. Beth theorizes that Tommy committed intercourse with the Froopyland creatures in order to produce children of which he would consume in order to sustain himself and Rick adds that it is also likely that the less appetizing of them (for Tommy) would worship Tommy as their god. Rick's assumption is revealed to be true once the two are captured by a group of Tommy's children (human/Froopyland creature hybrids). Upon being captured and brought before Tommy, they learn (to no surprise) that he has become the dimension's de facto leader and commits incest with his children as well as cannibalism to survive, just as Rick and Beth figured out. However, Tommy reveals in a play thatBethwas the one responsible for trapping him in Froopyland, out of jealousy for his own father. Following the play, Tommy decides to give a \"demonstration\" on how he nourishes himself in Froopyland, to which Rick responds out of disgust by quickly leaving with Beth in tow. When Beth asserts that their \"adventure\" is not over, Rick tries to justify keeping Beth in Froopyland for most of her childhood by saying that she was \"a scary fucking kid\" that frequently asked him to make borderline, if not blatantly, psychotic toys and devices to use on the neighbors' kids. Beth tries to blame Rick for her actions, claiming that she only did it so Rick would spend more time with her, and she resolves to save Tommy from the dimension. But when she refuses to apologize for trapping him in Froopyland, Tommy refuses to leave and sics his children on her, causing her to go into a defense-induced killing frenzy, during which she presumably kills Tommy. Beth returns with his severed finger and Rick and Beth create an adult clone of Tommy in order to save his father from lethal injection. Pondering her life and finally confronting Rick, Beth discovers she has two options: leave the family to travel the cosmos while Rick replaces her with a clone, or stay with the family and be content with the life she has chosen. Her decision is left ambiguous."

When the reception erupts into chaos, Birdperson is shot multiple times and seemingly killed, much to Rick's horror. As the majority of the criminals attending the wedding are gunned down, Rick is about to use his portal gun when Tammy ambushes him and holds him at gunpoint, ordering him to give up the gun. He does so, although he also wires it to kill several Galactic Federation officers and explode before it is able to be recovered. Consequently, the explosion also renders Tammy temporarily deaf. As the final few shots are fired from those still living, Squanchy provides a diversion for the family to escape by drinking a potion and turning into a large warrior, temporarily fighting off the surviving Galactic Federation goons and avenging many of his allies' deaths."

BethandJerryleave on a trip to experience theTitanic 2, a recreation of the Titanic experience. Jerry is immensely excited to reenact moments from the movie, while Beth is hesitant and overall uninterested. In Beth and Jerry's absence, Beth ordersRick,Morty, andSummernot to trash the house while they are gone and she threatens to put an end to Rick and Morty's adventures if they do. The trio agree as Beth and Jerry drive off. Summer ignores the warnings and attempts to throw a party to become popular. Rick declines due to his plans to throw a party of his own. Beth and Jerry arrive at Titanic 2, which is a replica of the ill fated ship the RMS Titanic. Jerry sees the line to reenact the famous bow scene from the movie and tries to bring Beth along. Beth blows off his request, and shoves a nearby maidLucyto join him instead. The two bond quickly over a mutual love for the Titanic. Meanwhile, the party at the Smith Residence begins. Some of the party-goers includeGlip Glops,Brad,Bird Person,Gear Head,Squanchyand many more. The party begins to amp up and Morty confronts Rick about their decisions.Jessicaappears, and Morty shifts his attention to talking to her. Jerry and Lucy continue to enjoy themselves on the ship, but the planned sinking of the ship goes wrong, and the ship doesn't sink due to technical difficulties. Rick's party is getting crazier, Summer blows off a friend of hers namedNancy, which draws criticism from Rick.Abrodolph Lincolerthen smashes through a wall. He gets into a brief altercation withBradwho promptly beats him up. Jessica is upset and runs outside, and Morty joins her to console her. While showing her various gadgets in the garage, he walks in on Squanchy masturbating (or \"squanching,\" as he calls it) in a closet, and in the process accidentally knocks over a contraption that teleports the entire house into a weird planet. After Rick takes a look outside, he lets the party-goers know that everything is fine. Morty begins to freak out about the repercussions of his actions. Rick calms him down and tells him to collect someCollaxion Crystals, which would ostensibly be used to take them back home. Rick convincesAbrodolph Lincolerto join Morty, and Summer talksNancyinto joining them as well. The three set out to find the crystals.

He is mortally wounded whilst defending them. The remainder of the group return to the party and give the crystals to Rick who promptly crushes them up and snorts them. Rick's eyes turn blue, as he gets high, and he starts a rave called the \"Rick Dance\" along with other party-goers. Rick admits that he can take them back whenever he wanted. Morty, furious after being lied to, throws the rest of the crystals outside. Meanwhile, Jerry attempts to break away from Lucy on the Titanic 2, but she pulls a gun on him and threatens him. She forces him to a prop car, where she attempts to force herself onto him. Beth arrives just in time, and knocks Lucy out with a book. Beth and Jerry pack up their car to leave and Lucy attaches herself to the underside of the car. She holds on briefly before falling and being run over, presumably killing her. Meanwhile, Morty ends the party and forces everyone out. The Smith House is in total shambles, and the cleanup effort begins. Morty is still immensely upset at Rick, but a conversation withBird Personreveals to him that Rick is masking a great deal of inner pain, and shows Morty that if he truly wants to stop dealing with his grandfather, he should just leave the place destroyed. At first, Morty agrees that this might be the best thing that ever happened to him because  will be free of Rick forever. Birdperson then teaches him another saying that means \"Whatever lets you sleep at night.\""

It premiered on August 16, 2015. It was written byMike McMahanand directed byJuan Meza-León. The episode is rated TV-14-DLV. The family battles a parasite that implants fake memories into their heads, which leads them to wonder if any of them are real. The Smith Family is having breakfast withJerry's older brother,Uncle Steve, when Jerry receives an email about purchased plane tickets. Uncle Steve then admits that he bought them as a thank you to the family for letting him stay for the past year. WhenRickcomes into the room, he doesn't know who Uncle Steve is, and the family rebuffs him, claiming that Uncle Steve has stayed with them for the past year. Rick then pulls out a laser pistol and shoots Uncle Steve, who turns out to be a monster. While the Smith family gasp in shock at the realization that Uncle Steve wasn't real, Rick informs them that he was a parasite, an alien species that survive and multiply by implanting fake memories into people's head so they can conquer planets. He tells them to be aware of \"wacky, zany characters that suddenly appear\" and is encouraged by a newly introduced zany character,Mr. Poopybutthole. In the living room, everyone is checking for more parasites. Rick makes a sign and places it on the wall saying that there should only be 6 people in the house: Rick, Morty, Jerry,Beth, Mr. Poopybutthole, andSummer. Saying that they can't take chances of letting parasites out of the house, he activates blast shields that keep people from coming in or out of the house, much to the chagrin of the rest of the family. Mr. Poopybutthole encourages the family to remember the time the family got stuck in an elevator after watching a musical featuring The Hulk and were freed by \"Cousin Nicky\". The memory flashback causes a parasite to multiply, and Cousin Nicky is shown in the room. After looking at the sign, Rick shoots Cousin Nicky in the shoulder, which turns him into a dead parasite. After another memory flashback, where a Nazi as well as a butler namedMr. Beauregardappear. As more and more memory flashbacks occur, more and more parasite characters appear (such asFrankenstein's Monster, a man named Sleepy Gary who isBeth's husband, food themed warriors, etc.). Rick starts to become irritated at the surplus of parasites and insults them all while they attempt to persuade Rick to disable the blast shields. After being goaded into having a flashback of having a barbecue with more characters, he is pushed over the edge and the house is filled. As arguing ensues, Jerry has suspicions that he is a parasite and confides in Sleepy Gary, who he truly believes is Beth's husband. Comforting him, Sleeping Gary implants a memory of he and Jerry having an affair while on a vacation, making the latter believe that they are in love. As he insults more and more parasites, the aliens start to turn suspicion onto Rick, manipulating the false memories in the Smiths to turn them against him. The Smiths constantly attempt to persuade Rick into freeing everyone from the household even afterReverse Giraffespeaks. After he refuses to do so, the parasites soon beat up Rick and steal the watch that controls the blast shield. After Rick insults the Smith Family (mostly Morty) for not trusting him, Morty takes Rick's gun. Unable to kill Rick in front of a zany character namedPencilvester,Baby Wizard,Duck With Musclesand Morty take him out to the garage. After telling Rick that he'll remember him as a friend and unsatisfied, Rick retorts that he'll remember Morty as a \"whiny bitch\" citing that a minority of his memories of Morty were pleasant, and the majority were just pure annoyance. However, after listening to Ricks statement about good and bad memories, Morty has an epiphany and shoots Baby Wizard and Duck with Muscles. He explains to Rick that he found the tell-tale sign; the parasites were only capable of creating pleasant memories. So, he was able to know that Rick was real by all the terrible memories he had of him. Realizing Morty's theory was correct, Rick unlocks his armory and they both heavily arm themselves."

While getting ready for an adventure, Rick and Morty stop to talk to Jerry, who is on top of the roof, trying to set up Christmas lights. Morty passes on Beth’s concerns that Jerry will kill himself in the light-hanging process. Jerry says he can hang lights safely; Rick responds by accusing Jerry of lying. Jerry promptly falls off the roof, but before he hits the ground, Rick zaps him with a ray that makes Jerry’s body lighter than air. He then zaps Jerry’s shoes with a ray that makes them heavier than air, rendering Jerry “neutrally buoyant”. As Rick and Morty climb into the spaceship, Jerry celebrates his buoyancy, which allows him to jump high up in the air and then slowly sink back down. Remembering a warning that the ray will eventually wear off, Jerry sets a timer to keep track of how long he will be neutrally buoyant. In space, Rick and Morty are arguing about piss and centipedes when (somehow) the spaceship hits “a sharp thing in space” and gets a flat tire. Rick puts on a spacesuit and goes out to fix the flat, giving Morty strict instructions not to follow. Morty promptly ignores these instructions, dons a spacesuit, and goes outside. Rick, who is fixing the flat, starts yelling at Morty to go back in the ship. While the two are arguing, a snake astronaut slithers up and bites Morty in the ankle. Morty kills the snake by breaking its astronaut suit with a hubcap, but it is clear he has been seriously injured. Soon afterward, Morty begins to turn purple, a symptom of the venom that the snake injected into him when it bit him. Rick flies to the snake’s home planet, scans it, and synthesizes an anti-venom serum, which promptly cures Morty. The scan also reveals that the snakes on the planet have formed an advanced patchwork of industrial societies— there are 19 billion snakes divided into 10,000 nations, all on the brink of global war because of race. Rick remarks that the concept of racist snakes is hilarious, and begins to fly away. Morty, horrified that he killed an astronaut who might have been the snakes’ last hope for survival, and despairs that he is the reason “19 billion snakes lost all hope!” Rick responds that the snakes’ loss of hope is their own fault, reminding Morty that the snake astronaut bit its first alien contact."

He confronts Dr. Wong, claiming her advice didn't work, but Dr. Wong points out that by not interfering with galactic affairs, Rick has gotten what he wanted: he is unburdened from needing to prove his power to other people, and thus he doesn't have to interfere with the rest of the galaxy."

When Rick and Morty enter into a mysterious new realm called the Fear Hole, the two must learn to overcome their greatest fears and know what it's like to live with themselves. RickandMortyexplore a \"Carnival of Nightmares\" theme park on an alien planet and quickly realize that they are too desensitized to be afraid of any of the attractions.A man in a suit, claiming to be a fear connoisseur, approaches them and offers to show them the scariest place in the galaxy. The two accept, and allow the man to lead them to what looks like an unremarkableDenny'son Earth. The man in the suit wishes them good luck, and leaves. Assuming they've been conned into giving the strange man a free lift, Rick and Morty enter the restaurant and order food. Unexpectedly, the waiter informs them of the \"Fear Hole\" in the men's washroom. Rick and Morty find a strange hole on the ground in one of the stalls. A TV/VCR is setup next to the hole. The suited man appears on the TV and explains that the Fear Hole manifests one's greatest fear, giving one the opportunity to conquer it and emerge fearless (and also have their picture displayed on the restroom's bulletin board). Uninterested, Rick walks away, but Morty jumps right in. Inside, he faces a dark, monster-infested environment where creatures attempt to dissect him and stuff him with maggots. Rick follows in, arriving at the scene to fight off the monsters. He rescues Morty, and together they jump out of the hole to safety. Satisfied with their victory, Rick and Morty return home to the living room and brag about their feat. Suddenly, a portal appears in the ceiling from which a young Rick emerges, crashing into the room, protectively embracing his wifeDiane. The younger Rick disintegrates, leaving the young Diane confused and distressed. Both Rick and Morty conclude that they must still be in the Fear Hole and head to the garage and discuss their predicament. Upon reflection, Rick surmises that to leave the Fear Hole, Morty must overcome his fear of seeing Rick happily reunited with Diane and of losing significance for Rick.  Morty finds Rick's theory backhanded. Rick, purportedly wanting to gather more data to confirm his theory, drops the conversation and decides to take Diane,Beth, and Morty out for ice cream."

The episode starts with a version of Beth leading a group from the Galactic federation's troops. Beth quickly ended most of them leaving one guard alive. She told the guard her name and tells him to say that the Defiance lives on to the top bugs. The bug guard agrees ensuring that he would make her a legend although it was making it difficult for him to construct such an idea since Beth's name is so plain. The bug guards then forgets Beth's name but then Beth kills him. The next scene appears to be a secret base where Beth is stationed. Beth is being repaired on her shoulder while watching an ad about a planet-destroying machine. The doctor who is repairing Beth's arm tells Beth if she ever missed Earth. Beth tells him that she's aware that there was a clone of her on Earth making her \"technically\" there. The doctor points out that Beth had a proximity device in her neck. He thinks that the bomb indicated that Rick didn't actually want Beth back and that he liked the clone better. He then offers Beth a drug to help her with her \"soul-crushing\" but it was addictive. But he swaps out for the correct one and then he eats one. Now back on Earth, Beth is talking about Dr. Wong being open for family therapy. Rick then tries to act as if he was disintegrated but Morty points out that Rick simply used an invisibility belt. Jerry proves this by grabbing Rick's crouch causing Rick to uncloak. Morty says that he wanted to use the belt even though Rick never let him. Summer pitched in saying that if she can use the belt to piss of Morty. Rick gives Summer the belt with a smug look towards Morty. Summer turns invisible as Morty tries to take it from Summer. Beth stops Morty and says that both Summer and Morty should share it. Jerry enters with a puppet \"Mr. Nibbles\". Morty then runs to catch Summer as she leaves the front door. Rick says to both Jerry and Beth that they can't control their kids and that it was a good thing Dr. Wong was available.

When Morty's offered a gift from a stranger, Rick tells him not to accept. Does Morty listen? No, he does not, and he's sucked into a messy adventure. Morty drags Rick to a galactic pop-up restaurant located on an asteroid, to Rick's displeasure. While waiting in line, Morty picks up the dropped sandwich of two armored knights and tries to return it to them, politely declining their offer for him to keep the sandwich since he prefers to stand in line. One of the knights, Sir Helios, offers Morty his sword and his title as a Knight of the Sun. Rick discourages Morty from taking it, but Morty gets pressured by the knights and various other aliens offering to take it instead to go ahead and take the sword. Sir Helios dubs Morty \"Sir Mortaniel\" and kills himself with the sword. Rick watches in bewilderment as Morty is abruptly transported with the other knight to the Sun, then questions why the other aliens are not simply eating the dropped food. One of the patrons reveals they are paid by the pop-up to stand there to drive up business, which Rick suspected. Morty arrives on the Sun to find it contains a medieval-like feudalist society living on a massive walkway, and agrees at the encouragement of the other knights and the King of the Sun to join them as an immortal being. That is, until he learns that a requirement of new knights is to cut off their penis. He promptly declares he is no longer interested, to the Knights' shock. Rick arrives to help Morty get out of his situation, but the King of the Sun demands Morty best him in combat if he wishes to leave. Rick gives Morty an AI Sword, which allows Morty to defeat the King easily. However, this backfires when the King relinquishes his crown and the Solar Scepter, declaring Morty is now King of the Sun before also killing himself. The Knights hail \"King Mortaniel\" but Rick and Morty promptly leave through a portal."

Beth and Jerry go to \"off-planet\" marriage counseling. While eating breakfast, Jerry asks his childrenSummerandMortyif anything interesting is happening at school. Morty responds, after thinking for a moment, that one of the lunch ladies was found dead, her body drained of blood and marked by two holes in her neck. Beth's horror, as she has no idea how such a horrible thing could happen, is quickly quenched by a nonchalant Rick, who reveals that vampires are real; the revelation horrifies Summer, but Rick casually tells her that humanity has known of their existence for hundreds of years. Terrified of the possibility of being killed by a vampire, Summer desperately asks to grandpa Rick if he could go to their school by transferring his consciousness into the body of a teenager, which Rick considers a stupid idea and insults Summer for it. Beth tries to get Jerry to support Summer, but Jerry is too distracted by his tablet to pay attention, leading to a conflict. Rick grows tired of their fights and declares that he will take them to off-planet therapy to fix their relationship. At school Morty and Summer discuss how best to deal with the vampire issue when they are greeted by \"Tiny Rick\": Rick decided to help them out by putting himself into high-school aged clone of himself temporarily. After killing the vampire (who as it turns out wasCoach Feratu), Tiny Rick heads home to transfer his mind into the older Rick's body, which is stored in a vat in the garage. However, Summer gets a text fromToby Matthewsasking if they could have a party at the Smith house, but wants to have Tiny Rick there as well. Tiny Rick decides to stay in his younger body to let Morty and Summer have a party. At the party Tiny Rick performs a song on his guitar, the lyrics of which sound like desperate pleas from the older Rick to get him out of Tiny Rick's body, but nobody notices except Summer, who realizes something odd is happening. Tiny Rick quickly becomes popular with the rest of the school, in turn increasing Morty and Summer's social standing, but Summer becomes increasingly worried that Rick has become trapped in his young body. Morty initially ignores her as Jessica has begun talking to him as a direct result of Tiny Rick, but his suspicions are raised when Rick's dance solo at the school dance includes lyrics practically begging someone to help him return to his old body. Unwilling to let this continue, Summer hides the wooden stakes they used to kill Coach Feratu in Tiny Rick's locker, resulting in his expulsion. Tiny Rick turns the entire school (including Toby Matthews) on Summer. Morty finally has enough, and he and Summer sneak up on Tiny Rick just as he is trying to destroy Rick's original body and they force him to listen to Elliot Smith music. Rick's emotional reaction to the music allows him to break free of his younger self's control, and he gets his grandkids to transfer his mind back to his older body. Once this is finished, he heads down to his underground lair and brutally destroys his other younger clones, with a newfound respect for his current age. After Rick drops off (or rather abandons) Beth and Jerry at therapy, they are greeted byGlexo Slim Slom. Glexo puts Jerry into a helmet attached to a machine that createsJerry's perception of Beth, a monstrous creature. Beth is immediately offended by this, telling Jerry to take it back. Beth then puts on the helmet, creating aweak, worm version of Jerry. Jerry is also upset by Beth's perception of him. Glexo then leads the couple and other visitors on a tour of the facility, where all the couples' perceptions are kept in cages. The idea behind the therapy is that the perceptions are not the real marriages and that they are all safe from the perceptions. However, in a major disaster, Beth's mytholog manipulates Jerry's mytholog into helping her escape, and she rampages through the facility, killing staff and visitors alike. Glexo angrily informs Jerry and Beth that this is a sign that their relationship has become co-dependent, and the truth is neither of them should ever have gotten married (to which Jerry and Beth declare this is just bad couple's therapy). When the evacuation results in Jerry and Beth being left behind in the facility, Beth gets kidnapped by her own mytholog and attached to one of the machines to make more of her pathetic Jerrys. Beth questions why not just have Jerry make more Beths, but her mytholog replies that in Jerry's mind there can only be one true Beth. Jerry, encountering his own mytholog, grows frustrated that this is Beth's perception of who he really is and heroically comes to rescue her, causing Beth to create heroic Jerry mythologs who help Jerry in his fight (only to start making narcissistic Jerrys when she gets annoyed with his self-indulgent monologue). Just when it looks like they are losing the battle with the Beth mytholog Jerry has the idea to attach the helmet to one of his strong selves, creating Goddess Beth who destroys the monster, ending the fight. As the Jerry mythologs bow down to their goddess, the real Beth and Jerry reconcile."

Nick, somehow familiar with Rick, cites their relationship as abusive and encourages Morty to embrace this change, while Rick easily catches and trains two crows. Morty tracks Nick down, finding him in a mental hospital. A sheepish Nick explains he met Rick at a bar and became too curious about his portal gun, leading Rick to shoot him out of a catapult and force a mental breakdown.

With the annual Flu Season Dance coming up, Morty talks toJerryabout his issue. Jerry compares Morty's fondness for Jessica to his own fondness forBethwhen he was a teenager.Rickoverhears Jerry's story and reminds him that said fondness resulted in Jerry getting Beth pregnant at 17. Rick proceeds to warn Morty not to go to Jerry for romantic advice because, \"his marriage is hanging on by a thread\". An insulted Jerry remarks that there isn't a problem with his marriage. Unconvinced, Rick tells Jerry that he can believe what he wants but it's pretty obvious that Beth is looking for an excuse to leave him. Morty becomes upset and asks Rick not to talk about his parents in that fashion. In response, Rick tells Morty that what people interpret as, \"love\" is just a chemical that causes animals to breed and once that has happened, any true passion fades away. After Rick leaves, a depressed Morty goes upstairs to prepare for the dance and a nervous Jerry goes to check on Beth. Thinking about what Rick told him, Morty approaches Rick and requests a potion that can make Jessica like him. After a brief argument, Rick calls Morty a, \"thorn in his ass\" and gives Morty a serum based off the genetic makeup of voles, a rodent that pair bonds with its mate for life. Before leaving, Morty asks if there's anything that could go wrong with the serum and Rick answers no. Once Morty has left, however, Rick quickly adds, \"unless she has the flu\", but shrugs it off. At the dance, Morty uses the serum on Jessica, and, save for her dilated pupils, it seems to be a success. When Brad sees Jessica holding Morty, he becomes angry and tries to wrestle him away from her. Things only get worse when Jessica begins to sneeze. The serum, which has piggy-backed onto the flu virus and has caused the virus to replicate in seconds, is seen to go airborne, infects Brad with the serum. Brad quickly apologizes to Morty but begins to make sexual advances on Morty which leads to another scuffle between Jessica and Brad. EventuallyPrincipal Vaginaleads Brad away, while Brad sneezes causing the serum laced flu virus to enter the fruit punch and air vents. Soon everyone at the dance is infected with the flu and subsequently the serum. Morty prays that everything go according to plan, when Jessica starts aggressively telling Morty to have sex with her on the spot, in front of the entire school. Morty is unsurprisingly mortified and Jessica's friend tells her to control herself, before she begins to make advances on Morty as well. Morty slowly backs up and notices that everyone in the room now has dilated pupils and they're all looking at him lustfully. Realizing what has happened with dread, Morty feebly whimpers, \"Oh, crap!\". The students and faculty swarm around Morty, with each of them violently competing to have Morty for themselves. Morty eventually manages to get away from everyone and makes a break for the exit where Rick is waiting for him. Rick tells Morty that he realized that he messed up and explains how this all happened. Terrified, Morty asks Rick what they're going to do and Rick tells him that he's already whipped up an antidote using praying mantis DNA as the base, claiming that they're the, \"opposite of voles\" due to their nature to only mate once before the female devours the male. Rick releases his antidote along with a second, more powerful airborne virus. Upon releasing the new airborne serum, Rick tells Morty that the serum doesn't affect anyone related to Morty by blood so luckily it means none of his family will want to have sex with him. For a moment, the antidote appears to have been successful, until everybody starts growing mantis-like features and other appendages. Now not only do they still wish to copulate with Morty but also have the urge to behead and eat him afterward. This Mantis-love virus soon infects the entire Earth population, all of which not only wish to mate with Morty but consume him afterwards."

Despite being treated well by Unity, Summer protests the loss of the original population's individuality, but, as Unity controls every mind on the planet, her attempts to \"free\" the inhabitants do not go very far. Elsewhere on the planet, Unity and Rick waste no time rekindling their relationship rather extravagantly. Not long after, a neighboring hive mind calledBeta-Sevenarrives on a routine trading mission. Beta-Seven is ostensibly attempting to pursue a closer relationship with Unity, but its awkward efforts only cause Rick to make fun of it. As it leaves, Rick notices the materials Beta Seven left behind can be mixed into various drugs to help spice up his and Unity's partying and kinky sex. Meanwhile, back on Earth, Jerry enters the garage looking for the weed-whacker because the weeds in the cracks made from the house being transported to another dimension have started to become overgrown. He is confronted by Beth, who chastises him for being in the garage when Rick is not present. The two argue, but are interrupted by a gurgling sound from under what they discover to be a hatch in the floor."

BeforeRickunfreezes time, he admits that 'their' time may need time to stabilize back within the 'world's time'. As a precaution, he tells Morty and Summer not to touch their parents at all, or otherwise their existence might fall apart at the seams. When time is unfrozen, Mr. Benson falls off the roof while both Jerry and Beth are very clearly confused with the entire house not destroyed. Rick insists that Jerry was just seeing the negative and he warmly greets Beth. Beth attempts to hug her father and children, but they pull back, insisting it's because they missed them a lot and hugging would destroy them (it literally would). As a means to play it safe, Rick bribes the two into leaving to buy ice cream. He kicks a pile of unmarked bills to get them out of the house. Soon, Morty and Summer experience a bit of sibling rivalry over who's closer to Rick. As they shove each other, it generates a direct rift in time, creating two parallel realities which exist separately from each other. Rick tells his grandchildren that their 'uncertainty' has caused time to fracture into two equally possible impossibilities. Rick says they aren't in any timelines, and to prove it he opens the garage door to reveal the house floating in the middle of a black void surrounded by Schrödinger's cats. After getting ice cream, Jerry and Beth accidentally strike a deer. The deer isn't killed but severely injured. Beth takes it upon herself to help heal the deer. Beth takes the deer into a veterinary hospital and attempts to perform surgery. Before she begins her procedure, she notices a gunshot wound in its side. A hunter appears and says he was the one who shot him. He claims the deer belongs to him and calls his lawyer to help him gain ownership. The hunter's lawyer appears at the animal hospital and lets them know about Brad's Law and how legally the deer belongs to the hunter. Beth ignores him and continues to operate."

After an argument in the lab, Rick and Jerry swap minds and then things get hectic when both of them become one half of each other especially when criminal gangs are involved. Rick is fixing his flying saucer in the garage, when Jerry comes by asking for help. Jerry's rake has gone missing and he thinks their neighbor Gene, who previously borrowed the rake, is lying about still having it. When Rick offers only a gun to help, Jerry insults Rick claiming that his naturally superior intellect is completely wasted on his reprehensible personality. Taking offense at the idea that he was simply born smart, and the implication that effort and dedication played no part in his achievements, Rick decides they should swap minds-that is, to insert Rick's mind into Jerry's brain, and Jerry's mind into Rick's brain-so that they can find out together the true meaning of waste. Upon swapping minds, Rick, in Jerry's body, has a nervous breakdown and blows his brains out onto the garage shelf and walls.[3]Jerry, unable to control Rick's cyborg body, accidentally kills himself when his jet-pack misfires.

On the ride through space, Jerry questions Rick's motive for inviting him, to which Rick explains he only did so at Morty's behest, worried that his father might turn to suicide. The reluctant duo arrives at anintergalactic resortonanother world. When Rick and a supposed enemy (Shnoopy Bloopers) kill each other, then immediately come back to life, he explains to a shocked Jerry that the entire facility is surrounded by an immortality field, meaning that even if Jerry tried to kill himself while on their vacation, doing so would be impossible. Rick and Jerry have a drink at the bar and bond a little while alien watching.  Jerry is captured while using the resort's restroom and is brought before an actual enemy of Rick namedRisotto Groupon, whose people were enslaved after Rick sold weapons to their enemies. With Jerry's help, he plans to assassinate Rick on a roller-coaster called the Whirly-Dirly, at the point where the ride travels outside the protective immortality field. When Jerry politely declines, Risotto allows him to leave unharmed. Jerry continues to drink with Rick, however, during the conversation Rick admits that he was essentially the whole reason Beth broke up with him. His new view of Rick now shattered, Jerry invites Rick to join him on the Whirly-Dirly. However while on the ride Rick apologizes for breaking up the marriage. A guilty Jerry changes his mind about killing Rick, but he can't get Rick off the ride once they're rolling. Assassins in a seat behind them take a shot; Jerry is killed but quickly revives. Rick notices the assassins and fights back. In the midst of the brawl, Jerry calls out to Rick and points to the area that dips outside of the field. Once the assassin has been dealt with Rick realizes something is amiss and asks Jerry how he knew about the kill point. He's interrupted when several more hit-men in a helicopter attempt to physically pull Rick outside the immortality field. Rick releases his lab coat, which detonates a bomb hidden inside, taking out the chopper and sending the roller coaster crashing into the surrounding jungle, deactivating the resort's immortality field in the process. A suspicious Rick again asks Jerry how he knew about the Whirly-Dirly, and a dying assassin reveals that they had made a deal. Rick angrily advances on a cowering Jerry, causing him to back into a massive alien snake.  Rick refuses to help as Jerry is slowly devoured. Jerry denounces Rick as a \"self-righteous piece of shit\" who stole his family. Infuriated, Rick volleys back by reminding Jerry that Beth was his daughter before she was his wife, and that her life was stolen when Jerry got her pregnant at prom, subsequently removing her from Rick's life. Further, Rick claims that Beth had options, but gave it all up because she felt sorry for Jerry. Risk accuses Jerry as acting like prey but really being a predator that feeds off other people's attention and pity. As Jerry is about to be digested, Rick finally kills the snake and saves him, only to then use him as bait to entice another alien creature. Just before Jerry is eaten, Rick shoots a tranquilizer into the creature and attaches wires to it, allowing him to control it and take them to an airfield with a shuttle that will get them close to the Milky Way."

One week later, Morty relaxes at home, thinking back at his deed, before he notices a familiar barrel Rick brought back with him. To his shock, he learns that Rick borrowed a barrel of \"horse semen\" from the hospital to create a bioweapon, to be used on an underground race of cannibalistic horse people called \"chuds\" that he and Morty have been fighting. After Morty frantically convinces Rick not to test the semen to verify that it indeed belongs to a horse, Rick proceeds to work on his experiment. A power surge goes through it and the barrel explodes. When Morty comes to, he sees that the sperm have mutated into floating, toothy monsters that eat humans. Rick blames himself, believing he brought in a bad sample, much to Morty's guilt and relief. The family is airlifted to the Pentagon's war room bythe President, where Morty agrees to lie for Rick and tells the President that they know nothing about the outbreak.

In the war room, Summer comes up with an idea to create a giant egg for the sperm to flock to, but has her idea stolen by Shabooboo. Blazen leads them into the caves where the sperm are hiding, and ends up stabbing himself in the chest and accidentally revealing that he wears a thong, shattering Rick and Morty's image of him.

With their basic brains, they love the idea of camping, so Jerry becomes their new leader. Morty and Summer go looking for him after a few days, only to find a crashed alien ship. Boarding it, Morty believes the controls are identical to his video game while Summer thinks the vapor the ship emits will grant her knowledge of how the controls and begins inhaling it. Soon she gets high off of the substance, and Morty tries to fly the ship. Meanwhile, a god-like being named Reggie arrives claiming he is the father of the children that Beth and Rick raised, and Gaia admits to Rick she made a mistake and doesn't know who the father is. Rick and Reggie both want to lay claim to the offspring, and quickly get into a fight. After a long brawl, Reggie gets the upper hand and tells Rick he has no intention of raising his kids but simply wants to strike the fear of god (who, as far as he is concerned, is himself) into them. However before Reggie can kill Rick, Morty and Summer dispatch him by accidentally driving the spaceship through his brain. Boarding, Rick finds Morty and Summer high, and thanks them for saving his life. Rick tells them that video games and drugs are the best, although also points out Summer wasn't actually doing drugs, but rather - inhaling brake fluid. Rick soon inhales the brake fluid. While all this is going on, Beth's advanced Ricklets and Jerry's tribal Ricklets have gone to war with each other. However before the battle can go too far, Reggie's body falls on the city destroying it and killing many of the residents. Beth is sent flying over a cliff, and its left to Jerry to save her. He manages it, however the smell he now emits quickly quells any thought of thanking him for the rescue. Gaia is furious that her mate has been killed and forms an erupting volcano, the resulting lava killing most of the surviving society. Rick, Morty and Summer pick up Beth, Jerry and the last few survivors and fly off. The family finally leaves in their car, and gives the ship to the Ricklets (which Rick placing a tracer and a bomb on board, planning to blow it up if they come near Earth seeking revenge)."

It turns out to be a blue Gotron Ferret, one of five animatronic Voltron-like vehicles that Rick is obsessed with. While Morty tries to convince him to go to Boob World, Summer offers to help him take the Gotron back to Earth. As Morty watches them walk away, a voiceover not unlike one from a mafia movie sounds where he foreshadows dark times following the Gotron, until Summer cuts him off with her own voiceover, which Morty himself can hear. Rick, Summer and Morty collect the other four Gotrons offscreen and propose toBethandJerrythat they join them to stop an interdimensional monster.

Morty accidentally destroys the glass surrounding it, the Constitution itself, the Lincoln Memorial, the Liberty Bell, and the Statue of Liberty using a laser cutter, and a robot hidden inside the statue goes on a rampage. The government traps the two inside the Smith house. Two soldiers attack but a satellite dish deploys a plant like alien which promptly devours the two soldiers. Rick and The President both state their separate plans to get a presidential pardon/stop Rick to their parties. In the past, Rick had turned himself into a turkey and gotten a pardon from The President, so The President has sent out multiple armored trucks, only one of which contains the presidential turkeys and will be guarded by marines. Rick plans to sneak aboard by turning himself into a turkey before they arrive, because the human eye cannot recognize a turkey's face, but The President has a solution: turning several marines into turkeys, all of which swallow capsules that identify them as humans in turkey form. Rick and Morty turn themselves into turkeys and distract the soldiers surrounding their house with robots. They land on top of the truck, knock out two turkey marines, and disguise themselves using the marines' headsets. The President, realizing Rick's deception, turns himself into a turkey, and enters the pen where turkeys wait to be selected for a pardon. He immediately recognizes Rick and the two fight. In the scuffle, Rick knocks out The President's identifying capsule, which is swallowed by a random turkey. The marines pull out the wrong turkey and inject it with The President's DNA, which turns it into a doughier, slightly feathery version of The President. The remaining turkeys are sent into an underground chamber where the unpardoned ones go, and are met by a polio vaccine-mutated Franklin Roosevelt, who has become a large human-spider hybrid. Rick and Morty turn back into humans, the President saves Rick and Morty, and Morty burns FDR alive. Rick makes a deal with the President to make him human again in exchange for a pardon."

Rick gave the aliens in the Microverse another invention, known as the Gooblebox, which is a machine that generates electricity that powers everything in their society. The machine is activated by their work. Unbeknownst to them, the electricity that powers their society, also powers the giant battery they're inside of, which gives Rick's ship infinite power, so that he'll never need to pay money, do work, or run out of battery life every again. In \"The Ricks Must Be Crazy\", one of the aliens,Zeep Xanflorp, thought that it was too much work to use the Gooblebox and so he created a more efficient source of energy called the \"Miniverse Battery\", which was the exact same thing as the Microverse battery. Because they had this new source of power, they stopped using the Gooblebox and Rick's space cruiser could no longer function. Rick andMortyhad to travel into the Microverse. After a big extravaganza, Rick had explained to Zeep, what had happened, which led to a huge fight. Zeep wanted to kill Rick so that the Microverse would still be able to continue on, without them working for him and Rick wanted to keep the battery working. So, they got into a huge fight, trying to kill each other. Rick eventually beat Zeep in a fistfight, but left him alive and left. When Rick tried to start the car again, it worked. He explained this with the fact that, when he got back to his own universe, \"[Zeep] knew one of two things were going to happen. Either he would have to toss a broken battery, or the battery wouldn't be broken anymore.\" Because Zeep didn't want to have his entire world destroyed, he returned the Microverse population to using Goobleboxes for power. That is how the Microverse currently functions and how Rick's ship currently works."

The entire human race (excluding everyone blood-related to them) was mutated and Rick was too lazy to fix it, so instead, he and Morty just left thePrime Dimensionand went to areplacement dimension, where alternate versions of himself and Morty did fix the problem and conveniently died soon after, so Rick and Morty quickly buried their dead bodies and took their places in life, living on this new version of Earth, which was so ridiculously identical to their own planet, that there was no reason to acknowledge its difference ever again."

The President left the city once he learned Rick and Morty had already been there. The republic is structured in a circular shape round the main tower, which functions as the home of the Presidentress. Walls are built to create smaller round areas, each with a tall tower in the center acting as defense  mechanism and power source. There are a total of eight round walled areas within the republic. The outermost region of the city is agricultural, with different colored crops filling the available plains. The next region is the more populated with towers and mounds spread out across the grounds. This marks the beginning of the city and appears to hold less light than the more central areas. The second most inner region consist of three walled-in circular districts, where the areas are more red colored compared to the outer regions' brownish colored landscape. The innermost region is the home of the Presidentress and her tower. This area is orange colored, due to being most illuminated region."

Beth argued with Jerry while working on the horse, and that caused the horse to get close to dying a couple of times. Every time the horse began flat-lining, Tom would inform them about it, which eventually drove Beth mad. Later in the episode, Beth was seen in her office, arguing with Jerry again. Davin then came in and started to talk to Beth about how passionate it was that they saved that horse's life together. In the episodeRick Potion #9, Beth had to go to the hospital because there was a seven horse collision and so she had to work with Davin. When Jerry heard that Davin was going to be there, he became extremely jealous and drove over there. After the surgery, Davin took Beth into his office with her. When he did, he turned out the lights and lit some candles, attempting to seduce and have sex with her, revealing that he truly does have feelings for Beth and also proving Jerry right. However, before Davin could go deep into his love for Beth, theLove Potionandmantis DNAhad spread through the air vents and infected him, causing him to start changing his sexual feelings and begin having lust forMorty. He then started to chase Beth around the room like a crazed rapist, only talking about Morty. Jerry then busted in and beat Davin to death with a crowbar. The events of this episode were then undone as Rick and Morty traveled to adifferent dimension, where Rick had found a cure for theCronenberg virus, meaning that things must have happened a little differently, undoing all of these events. In the episodeA Rickle in Time, Beth nursed a deer back to health in another Animal Hospital, claiming that she is a certified horse heart surgeon. Although the real St. Equis Hospital was not seen or directly mentioned, Beth's employment and experience with the hospital had major significance in this episode. Beth lost her job inThe Rickshank Rickdemptionafter the Federation introduced medicine that made horses healthy forever, rendering hospitals like St. Equis redundant. As ofRickdependence Spray, through means unknown, the hospital is still open and Beth is back at her job."

Morty finds the whole situation morally reprehensible and immediately confesses to the situation at a funeral for one of the people they ate, against Rick's protests. He also tells his family, though he is annoyed when they are more disappointed at the loss of their spaghetti nights than the fact they were eating people. The president of 41-Kepler B contacts Morty after hearing about the funeral confession and offers Morty some \"ethically-sourced\" spaghetti, from a sickly person who sought assisted suicide and accepted their fate as food. This results in the planet turning the spaghetti into a full industry, selling cans of \"MortyO's Suicide Spaghetti\" across the galaxy. Morty proposes this is still ethical upon noticing the cans have messages from the people the spaghetti came from, until Rick brings him back to Spaghetti Planet and reveals the government have resorted to encouraging depression in the people in order to keep up with the demand. The president of Spaghetti Planet protests that they need to keep the spaghetti trade open or else it will destroy the global economy, which could prove much more destructive. Rick offers one last alternative: take the last person on the planet who is willing to kill themselves and genetically clone the spaghetti so people can still get their fix. However, they will broadcast a flashback of the man's life for the whole planet to see. As expected, the person's insides turn into spaghetti after he dies. However, having witnessed the entirety of Fred's life in all its nuances, no one wants to eat him or the spaghetti anymore. Rick explains to Morty it was never about it being right or wrong to eat dead people, and Rick loses his appetite for the spaghetti from having seen Fred's life, ending the spaghetti industry on the planet for good."

In the wake of losing his wife and daughter to a bombing byRick Prime, C-137 became consumed with finding his evil doppelgänger and eventually succeeded in creating his first Portal-Gun, allowing him access to the infinite multiverse and all the worlds beyond. For years, C-137 rampaged across the multiverse killing every other Rick he could find but never finding the one he sought. In doing so, he also took the opportunity to expand his intellect along the way by scanning and absorbing vast amounts of knowledge from numerous alien worlds into his brain until he became one of the smartest and most dominant beings in all of existence but not the smartest overall. Finally, after decades of hunting and killing, C-137 could take no more and signed a peace-treaty with a congregation of his counterparts, part of which involved the construction of a massive, hyper-metropolis space-station called the Citadel of Ricks to serve as a home for all the Ricks and Mortys in the multiverse. Unbeknownst to the Mortys however, C-137 and the fledgling Council of Ricks took things a step further by creating what became known as \"The Central Finite Curve\". Using an advanced variation of their portal-gun technology, they built a massive machine underneath the Citadel of Ricks designed to lock out travel to or from any universe, within the multiverse, in which Rick himself was not the dominant lifeform or the smartest being alive, for example, universes where Jerry is the smartest being in the universe, or universes where Rick Sanchez doesn't exist. This lockout ensured that all Ricks and Mortys could only travel to universes within the Central Finite Curve, universes where Rick was always guaranteed to be the most dominant and the smartest being alive."

They next reached a bar where Morty was attempted raped by King Jellybean and Rick won a large sum ofSchmeckles, which they gave to the village. As they left, Rick shot their king with hisLaser gunfor attacking Morty. The village on the surface is poor and dirty, with villagers not yet having discovered electricity or industrialization. The village leaders believe in upholding the image of their former king, King Jellybean, and keeping dirty secrets from surfacing; as shown when a villager found a box of graphic photos of King Jellybean, and was ordered to destroy it."

Uniquely, the prehistoric beasts of the area did not perish from the impact of a meteor, as purported by the common theory; conversely, many became buried alive in tree sap, preserved within the bowels of the Earth and remaining there for eons. According to tree ring interruptions and radiation tests, the entire valley of Gravity Falls was formed by analien spaceshipcrash-landing into Earth around 35 million years later. Whether the craft caused the town's strange properties or the place's strange properties attracted the craft is still unknown, however numerous anomalies such as electrical interference and sick livestock are linked to the ship's existence beneath the town. The first human inhabitants of the valley were Gravity Falls' native population, who mysteriously evacuated around 1000 AD after a shaman namedModoclearned of the prophecy that foretold the dreadfulWeirdmageddonfrom his interactions withBill Cipher. The valley was deemed a \"cursed land\" by the natives, who left behind troves of pottery, blankets, and art in local caves, relics that would one day be hoarded by the Northwests. Bill attempted to get his portal built with the help of various other humans from the ancient Egyptians, Aztecs and even Easter Island heads. His attempts in the dark ages with a wizard gave rise to \"Cipherstitions\" in the old, causing him to flee to the new world to try and get his portal built there. Bill tried using New England settlers to no avail and even convinced the leaders of the then newly created America to help him. His attempts would lead to the rise and fall of a group in 1901 known asThe Anti-Cipher Societythat tried to defeat him and spread awareness about his deception. They were deemed a joke and disbanded. About 1000 years before the events ofthe series, the world ofAmphibiawas highly advanced and its king,Aldrich Leviathan, at its capital cityNewtopiawas preparing to conquerEarth- when it was still medieval - to strip out its resources and commit genocide againstHumans. This plan was subsequently foiled by one ofhis son's friends,Leif, who opened a portal to Earth to grant theCalamity Boxto early Humans and keep it out of Amphibia’s reach."

When they arrived, they took the dead bodies of that dimension's versions of themselves, buried them in the backyard, and continued in this timeline. In \"Morty's Mind Blowers\", it is revealed that, at one point, Morty discovered that Dimension C-131 was run bysquirrels, who managed an elaborate underground conspiracy. When the squirrels found out he knew too much and started chasing after him, Morty ran back to Rick who neutralized the rodents and told Morty they had to move to another universe. Although behind the scenes, Rick and Morty solved the problem with the squirrels, because in subsequent episodes the crack around the Smith house from \"Ricksy Business\" and \"A Rickle in Time\" is still shown with the characters mentioning past events such as in \"Amortycan Grickfitti\".

Franklin Roosevelt appeared to look the way he used to back in the 1940's on the upper half of his body. He wore a pair of glasses that completely cover his eyes, and he had an old-fashioned pipe that sticks out of his mouth. Franklin wore an old worn-out suit, undershirt, and tie. On the lower half of his body, he appears to have a giant grey spider-like body with razor-sharp feet. After being mutated, it appeared that Franklin became a sadistic monster that only cared for carnage. Franklin often spoke some of his most memorable quotes, although he twisted the words in order to taunt his prey. Franklin also appeared to crave human flesh as well, wanting to killRickandMortyeven after they had turned back into humans. He was used to test an experimental polio vaccine that was based on spiders, because they have 8 legs and therefore \"walk the most\". To cover up turning FDR into a spider mutant, the federal government faked his death in 1945."

When he belives Jaguar is dead, he starts to unseal the building, but Pickle Rick decides to kill Pavel instead. Afraid for his life, he attempts to bribe Pickle Rick with $100million . Pickle Rick tells Pavel to give the money to Jaguar's daughter, but then Pavel reveals that Jaguar's daughter has already been dead for some time. After his agents calls an escape helicopter and the police, Pavel shoots them both and intends to escape in the helicopter with the agency's money. He is stopped when Pickle Rick and Jaguar steal the helicopter and Rick sets off a large quantity of explosives in the building. He falls to his knees and utters \"Farewell Solenya\" before the mansions blows up and kills him. Pavel Bartek is a cold and selfish man who cares very little for other people's lives. This is evident both with holdingJaguarcaptive in a dark cell for an unknown span of time, and when he shoots his own agents just before attempting to flee in a helicopter. His cowardice is shown when he offers Pickle Rick $100m worth of bonds belonging to the people in order to keep his own life. He has a habit of losing his temper whenever someone speaks out of turn or disobeys orders. He can be seen to be manipulative when he lies about Jaguar's daughter being alive in order to employ him against Pickle Rick, when she had already been dead for some time. However, the director is also relatively cunning and is nearly able to outsmart Pickle Rick, though it is eventually he who is outwitted."

Ultimately, Jaguar was able to enact revenge upon the director by hijacking his helicopter alongside Pickle Rick and leaving the director to die in an explosion. Before departing, Jaguar told Rick to ensure Beth knew he loved her. Rick told Jaguar about the infinite amount of Beths he has access to and how he had abandoned entire realities in the past, which led Jaguar to ask if he too had infinite daughters.

And while he returned to hunting Varrix onEarth(his domain), Kiara did not take the breakup lightly and sought to make him jealous by engaging in a new relationship on Earth where Trandor would notice. Jerry, being the coward that he is, blamed his childrenMortyandSummerfor his breakup with Kiara. This led her to chase them all into a cave with a small colony of Varrix. After Jerry owned up the reason behind their breakup, Kiara started on a rant on humanity before Trandor noticed them in the same cave. At once, Trandor knew why Kiara had appeared on Earth and did not seem to want to take her back. As they were arguing, Summer and Morty pick up Jerry who realizes that Kiara was using him to get back at her ex just as he was using her to get back to his ex. Trandor is a tall, blue scaled, somewhat fish-like alien with a broad build. His forehead has two horizontal white stripes running across and his chin two vertical lines, his ears appear flap-like with a large circular hole and the hair-area on his head is slightly more green in color. Several spikes can be spotted on his head. He is broad shouldered with three pecs as well as three fingers on each hand."

Unbeknownst to him, however, Toxic Rick has no intention of re-merging with Healthy Rick, instead trying and failing to trap him within the toxin tank (instead trappingStacy, who was trying to save Healthy Morty).

After seeking the recipe for dark matter, Nebulon created a plan to abductRickand place him into a simulated reality in order to trick him into giving up the formula. He employsKevinto research human nudity in order to simulate a convincing \"Morty\" to help bring Rick's guard down. While he successfully had Rick kidnapped, he also inadvertently hasJerry Smithkidnapped as well which forced him to divert a low amount of the simulation toward Jerry’s. After putting Rick and Jerry in a simulation, he had them put in several layers of more simulations, in hopes of tricking Rick into revealing the formula. Soon after waking up, Rick quickly realized that he was in a simulation while Jerry remained completely oblivious. This caused Rick to try to escape with Jerry and \"Morty\" which caused them to escape the first layer of simulation and go into the second layer, in which they distract the guards before boarding a shuttle. As the duo arrives home, Rick enters the code for his safe only for the second simulation to be revealed. As Nebulon reveals this to them and states how they now know the code for Rick's safe, Rick has \"Morty\" flash them before grabbing Jerry and escaping in one of the Zigerion ships in the hanger. As they escape the ship and are being chased by the Zigerions, Rick tells \"Morty\" the formula for the dark matter to outrun the them. Nebulon however stops the third layer of simulation and reveals the whole scheme to Rick, before having Rick and Jerry be jettisoned into space in an actual shuttle. After jettisoning the duo, Nebulon celebrates the achievement and tries to form dark matter with the given ingredients. However unbeknownst to the entire crew, the recipe was actually a bomb as Rick actually knew of the scheme from the very beginning. After pouring all of the ingredients together, the bomb explodes, killing Nebulon and his entire crew as Jerry observes while in safety in the shuttle."

He does seem to believe that his companions owe him after he takes them on adventures and can only repay him with sexual favors, going so far as to corner Summer from leaving his ship until she had repaid him; even threatening her with a gun. He is not very emotionally invested in his companions, not caring for more than a couple of seconds about Barbarica's death before moving on.

Barbarica leapt to fight with Peacock standig on the sideline, but before he could take advantage of Barbarica's arousal she was crushed by a hugePenpclubbed down by Morty.

She is a bookish only child of late middle-aged parents. Meeting outside a coffee shop, she and Morty quickly started a relationship after the latter created a save point before making his move on her. Because the relationship went smoothly at first, Morty had no reason to return to his saved point and thus the two spent a lot of time together. They had their ups and downs and at one point broke up, but soon missed each other and reunited. The two of them were then involved in a plane crash in arctic conditions. Nobody knew where they were, leaving Morty to go out and seek help. After he succeeded in doing so, she was happy to be home with Morty, until Jerry mistook the reset device for a TV remote and accidentally returned him to the point just before they met. Upon seeing the girl again outside the coffee shop, a bewildered Morty tried to get her to recognize him, but she was actually a \"near duplicate, equally probable\" version of her pre-Morty self and saw him only as a crazy, babbling stranger. When he touched her cheek she pepper sprayed him and ran away. Collapsing in pain, Morty fell onto the reset remote and created a new save point of her macing his face, thus ruining his chance at another shot with his former girlfriend. Later in the episode, her memories of Morty were restored after Rick merged all his alternate dimensions. In the ensuing public outcry she also would have learned of the bad things Morty did in those dimensions, but this did not destroy her feelings for him. When SWAT teams and a mob of protesters descended on Morty's house, she pushed her way to the front of the crowd and saw him jump into the vat of fake acid. Believing he was really dead, she ran away distraught. She is a teenager with a slender build, long dark-brown hair, a medium complexion, a Greek nose, and prominent rose-gold lips. She is taller than Morty, a common trait among his love interests. She wears glasses; a black choker; a form-fitting, teal thumb-hole shirt with a dark-teal design on its sleeves and a light-teal circle on the chest; a striped reddish-brown skirt; and tan coloured flats.

By the time he met Rick fromDimension C-137and Morty fromPrime Dimension, he had bags under his eyes, scruffy hair, a bruise on his right chin and wore a bloodied shirt. At some point, most likely due some reason to his grandfather Rick, Morty became obsessed with stopping fascism at all cost. He got himself a \"Hitler-measuring gun\" from his grandfather, which he took along with aPortal Gunand aLaser gun. From then on, he went from dimension to dimension, fighting and killing everyone who measured high on the \"Hitler-measuring gun\". In one dimension he met hisPrimecounterpart doing the exact same thing. They both scanned each other and prepared to shoot, but Rick C-137 shot this Morty first.

He was alsoRick Sanchez (C-137)'s proxy son-in-law and the son ofLeonardandJoyce Smith, and he had anUnnamed Uncle. Jerry strongly disapproved ofRick's influence over his son, Morty.

Jerry resided in the post-apocalyptic remains of his dimension. After losing his wife and daughter, he encountered theoriginal Rick from his dimension, who killed him after Jerry valiantly tried to fight him off. Like all Jerrys, Jerry always tried to keep the best interests of his family at heart, but his attempt to be the patriarch of the family was often misguided by his self-centered nature. This caused him a great deal of conflict withRick, as his father-in-law clearly had no respect for him whatsoever. The key divergence in this Jerry's timeline came when Rick caused the entire human population of his dimension to mutate intoCronenbergs. Jerry was forced to take charge and fight, protecting his Beth and Summer and finally gaining the confidence to be the man Beth could be happy with. After an unspecified amount of years have passed, he became a much more cruel, sadistic, and wild man, turning feral when finding the portal gun, destroying it, and trying to killSummer C-131."

Just like his human counterparts, Wasp Morty is a teenage boy who seems to have anxiety problems and may not be very intelligent. The notable differences between this Morty and others is that he's a wasp and has wasp like instincts like hunting for insects and eating them alive, or stinging people. In this universe the Smith family doesn't seem dysfunctional, a given example is when Wasp Rick called his whole family \"Beautiful\" or when he asked Beth if he could use Morty to bring Rick C-137 back to his reality instead of forcing him. Wasp Rick, afterRick C-137's appearance in his garage and doing a nervous \"heil wasp Hitler\", mentioned how Morty had been on some crazy message boards and asked Rick to drop the \"Hitler-stuff\". The Smith family gathered around the dinner table and ateCaterpillar Mr. Goldenfoldwith the newly arrived Rick C-137. Morty ate a couple of Goldenfold's side eyes and some intestants before Wasp Rick asked Beth if he could borrow his grandson to help their guest return to his reality. Morty was then asked by his mother if he had completed his homework, which he had not, so Rick could not borrow him after all. Goldenfold then produced three baby caterpillars, which Morty called \"Bonus\" and ate whole."

Sanchez III, also known asTycoon Rick[1], was an alternate version ofRick Sanchezwho first appeared in the episode, \"The Ricklantis Mixup\". He was the owner of Simple Rick's Wafers andSimple Rick’s Wafer Cookie factory. He was also part of theShadow Council of Ricks. Rick D. Sanchez IIIshared the general appearance of Rick Sanchez, though he wears a purple suit with green under shirt and green tie, purple top hat, and carries a gold cane quite similar to Willy Wonka. Due to being the owner of Simple Rick‘s Wafers and a member of the Shadow Council of Ricks, Rick D. Sanchez III was extremely wealthy and powerful. Despite initially appearing to be forgiving and quite charitable to Rick J-22, it’s soon made obvious that it’s nothing more than an act as like most other Ricks, he was actually cruel and greedy. As foreshadowed earlier when it’s that the primary ingredient for the taste of his company’s wafers were actually the drops made from the pleasant memories ofSimple Rickwho was held prisoner and forced to live through the same memories for each day of his life. Rick D. Sanchez III first appeared when he interrupted the SWAT Team Ricks who was in the process of entering the flavor core to take out Rick J-22 (after the latter accidentally executed his only hostage, Simple Rick). Sanchez III then stopped the other Ricks and seemingly pardoned Rick J-22. Immediately afterwards, he led J-22 to the outside of the factory while being cheered on by J-22’s coworkers and gave the terrorist a fully decked out limo. This, however, soon turned out to be nothing more than a ruse as Rick D. Sanchez III then tasered J-22 and made him the new replacement flavor of the flavor core. Hours later, Sanchez III went to a meeting between the Shadow Council of Ricks and the Citadel’s new president,Evil Morty. He arrived late to the meeting and arrived just time to see most of the other Ricks led byGarment District Rickdismiss Evil Morty’s position and power. This caused Evil Morty to hold a vote on which of the council agreed with Garment District Rick stance of which nearly everyone including Sanchez III voiced their agreement. This immediately resulted in Sanchez III and nearly all of the council being executed by the guard Ricks in the room upon Evil Morty’s orders. The remaining two council members that were still alive were only spared because of their decision to not vote against Evil Morty.  Minutes later, Sanchez III and all of the other deceased council members along with hundreds of other bodies were then flushed out into space as Evil Morty’s reign over the Citadel began."

While it was never explicitly shown, (likely due to him playing only a sidekick's role in Toxic Rick's plans) Toxic Morty is implied to have been very conscientious and moral, since these qualities were explicitly absent in Detox Morty, who at one point ordered Detox Rick to kill Toxic Rick.

Hologram Rick was a AI program created by Rick and installed into Morty's spine to guide Morty into cloning Rick if he ever were to die, which happened onForbodulon Prime. Hologram Rick was unable to convince Morty, who would rather follow aDeath Crystal. Rick self replicated and started protesting Morty's unwillingness to revive Rick, but stopped when Morty threatened to flush away Rick's DNA. He questioned Morty on what death he was intent on pursuing, but quickly understood it to involveJessica. He later returned while eating a bucket of hologram chicken and was offended when Morty asked why he pretended to eat chicken, sparking an argument on nutrition and food. When Rick andWasp Rickentered Rick's garage and found several weapons missing, Rick summoned Hologram Rick and accused him of growing sentience and trying to take over. Hologram Rick immediately called the accusation AI racism, before leading to the two wasps to Morty in the desert. They cut off Morty's connection to the ferrofluid, but it then latched onto Hologram Rick and turned him into a huge physical being. Happy to finally have mass, Rick proclaimed himself a god and stated they were through. Morty questioned this change and he explained that he was dissatisfied being a hologram. He attacked Morty and the two other Ricks. However, Wasp Rick managed to get in a sting on his left eye and laid eggs inside.

In the outside world, Jesus is affected by venom from the loop, killing him. Jesus' appearance seems to stem from His stereotypical appearance from both religious paintings and interpretations found within pop culture. As such, He wears robes, which cover His incredibly muscular body, as well as fair skin, long flowing hair and a beard. This Jesus was introduced into a story by Rick, so it could be assumed His appearance is also based on how Rick interprets Jesus."

Jerry acts like a winner and takes pride in himself being famous. He was very famous and he took so much pride in himself being famous that he acted pretty egotistical and self-absorbed about it. In high school, Jerry took his classmate Beth Sanchez to prom and impregnated her before the night was over. Not long after, they both drove to an abortion clinic and terminated the pregnancy, which also put a stop to their relationship. They split up before graduation, but Jerry still harbored feelings for his ex-girlfriend. While she went off to medical school, Jerry went into acting and movies; he beat Tom Hanks for the main role in the movieCloud Atlas.

He told them that he did not have any need to be part of the purge because he had no anger directed towards anyone, but gladly offered Rick and Morty to kill him, only to find out that all they wanted was to use his lighthouse for their beacon. He allowed them in, but told them that they could only do it if they listened to his tale. Rick set up the beacon while Morty sat through the Keeper's tale. As it turned out, the keeper's \"tale\" was actually a screenplay, centering on a woman named Jacey Lakums. Morty found the screenplay difficult to sit through, due to the keeper's lack of writing skill; the screenplay proved to be incoherent, boring, pretentious, and cliched. He found himself eatingYummy' Yumscandy bar to keep his patience. When the keeper finally finished telling his tale, he asked for Morty's opinion. Morty, attempting to be polite, merely told him that it was good. The keeper, pressing further, demanded constructive criticism, at which Morty suggested that a \"three weeks earlier\" framing device was unnecessary. In response, the keeper reacted poorly, declaring \"you're a petty person and you're insecure, and you're taking it out on me,\" and that he was now kicking the two of them out. The keeper barged upstairs to try to take down the beacon, while Morty followed him to talk him out of it. Over the course of explaining himself to Rick, Morty claims to have \"sat through\" the reading, which enrages the keeper further. At this point, Morty lets out his anger properly, simply telling the keeper flat-out that the screenplay was terrible. The scuffle between them escalates, and Morty shoves the keeper down the lighthouse stairs, at which he tumbles all the way to the bottom and snaps his neck on impact. Morty angrily shouts back, \"You want me to cut back to three weeks earlier, when you were alive?\" At first the Lighthouse Keeper appeared to be friendly man as he let Rick and Marty take shelter in his lighthouse so they could set up a beacon. Unlike other members of his species, he did not show any signs of violent tendencies and stated that he does not hold grudges towards anyone and is uninterested in taking part in the yearly purge festival. He is however quite stubborn as when he asked Morty to offer an honest critique on his screenplay and Morty tries to do so, the lighthouse chief quickly loses his temper and tells Morty to get out all while calling him a \"shitty person\"."

Interestingly, he had a bronze skeleton, a fact revealed only after a gruesome incident where his skin and limbs were ripped off. His overall appearance bore a significant resemblance to the DC Comics character Sinestro and to the iconic Queen lead singer Freddie Mercury, even donning one of Mercury's signature outfits. Knightly was a rather polite, albeit arrogant, individual with a deep admiration for the heist genre, seeing it as an art form. He was highly confident in his heisting abilities and was genuinely surprised when Rick outsmarted him in a \"heist-off,\" proof to his previous level of self-assuredness. Knightly comes into the storyline whenRickandMortydiscover Knightly's calling card after a tomb raiding adventure. This leads them toHeist-Con, a convention hosted by Knightly himself. He challenged Rick to a \"heist-off,\" which resulted in an unexpected turn of events. Rick, using his robotHeistotron, managed to outmaneuver Knightly's plans and cause a chaotic scenario where all attendees of Heist-Con were ordered to steal everything in the convention center. This led to Knightly's gruesome dismemberment and death. The competition known as the \"heist-off\" took place at Heist-Con, a convention for heist artists. In order to gain entrance as professionals (since Rick refused to attend as a fan), Rick and Morty were required to assemble a crew. Once inside, Rick and Morty immediately ditched their makeshift crew and proceeded to the convention hall where Miles Knightly was presenting a conference."

Practically nothing is known about the President or his past, other than the fact that he's the leader and highest-ranking member of the Galactic Federation and its Gromflomite soldiers. He is intent on discovering the secrets of portal technology so he can extend the influence of the Federation to multiversal degrees, hence why the Federation's biggest target is Rick Sanchez. Eventually, Rick hands himself in to the Federation, only for him to enact his master plan to destroy it by teleporting the Citadel of Ricks into his prison and hacking into the Federation's database, enacting the Federation's downfall by reducing its currency, the blemflark, to a worth of zero."

The robot produces Gazorpian offspring, and is made by female Gazorpazorps to sustain the population. They are sent out to have intercourse with male Gazorpians and then sent back to their base to \"give birth\". If the offspring is female, they will take care of it and raise it properly.

He murdered hisMortyin his garage. Rick is an alcoholic living in the Smith household with his daughter and her family. He would constantly be picked on by Morty for being of lower intelligence and for drinking. One day Rick had a dream where he was the smart one and Morty was an idiot. Morty used this to mock Rick while telling him to come to the garage. Once there, Morty told Rick to hand him a screwdriver before continuing to mock his dream, even finding it so ridiculous that he decided to tell the Council of Mortys about it later. Rick, in anger, grabbed a hammer and repeatedly hit Morty in the back of his head with it, killing him. This was witnessed byRickandMortyfromDimension C-132. He also appears inPocket Mortysas one of Rick's avatars. Rick is a dumb, elderly lazy man who dreams of being better than his grandson. Enduring years of mockery for his lower intelligence, he developed a secret hate for Morty, which led Rick to later murder him in rage. He did not seem to take joy in this, pointing to him being less sadistic than Ricks from other dimensions. Dumb Rick's universe is located in theCentral Finite Curve, where there are only infinite universes where Rick is the smartest being. Then it means that this Rick somehow lost his intelligence, and his Morty decided to continue his grandfather's scientific work."

He advertises the hole as an actual scary yet positively beneficial experience to Rick and Morty, and others watching the introduction tape. During a confrontation with Morty, the Man seemingly grows more sinister, cruel and malicious, declaring that he finds Rick's fear of being happy more \"delicious\" since it's so rare. He calls Morty \"dumb\" and a \"dipshit\" for not understanding why his grandpa is afraid of happiness; that it's all just temporary for him and can disappear suddenly or slowly. Despite this, he also says Morty is tougher to scare than Rick, and is only keeping Morty in the Hole to keep feeding off of Rick's fears until he is killed. He torments Morty by this threat by saying Rick will end up just like Diane;dead, a notion he finds funny."

It's unknown how long that clonerbeast had been involved there. According to Rick, clonerbeasts could be capable of taking down a whole society."

Being boneless, Jerry's Mytholog can morph its body into basic shapes, including flattening out to squirm under thin gaps. It has a constant look of worry and distress on its face even when killing others. Being based on Beth's personal perception of Jerry, Jerry's Mytholog is a comically exaggerated parody of the real Jerry: a spineless, mewling grub who cowers and submits before anyone and anything even vaguely threatening, but it follows Beth's Mytholog first and foremost. Even when chasing after the real Jerry, as soon as Jerry assumes a fighting stance, his Mytholog immediately backs off, showing its backside to him in a submissive stance."

After asking the cat where it came from, it brushes the question aside and merely requests that Jerry take it to Florida. When Jerry inquires as to why, the cat merely states that it wants to have fun there. After it plays volleyball with some party-goers on a Florida beach, the cat poops in the sand and barely covers it up. When one of the party-goers steps in it, the cat quickly shifts the blame onto Jerry. As the party continues onto a boat out in the ocean, the cat becomes puzzled as to why no one has commented on how it is able to speak and continually asks the party-goers if they are at all curious. This causes the cat to be thrown off the boat and it swims back to shore. After meeting back up with Jerry, the cat is picked up byRickwho drives them home. As they stop for a break, the cat is caught in a energy box by Rick who proceeds to start a mind scan on the cat to discover its origins. The cat begins to slightly panic and insists that it is simply from outer space and nothing more. This does not satisfy Rick or Jerry and they look through the vision goggles. The sounds of mass screams of terror can be heard, as Rick and Jerry viewed the cat's memories. Both are horrified by what they see with Jerry frantically crawling away to vomit several times and Rick nearly killing himself. The cat is set free and, when ordered to leave, protests that it has nowhere to go. Its pleas fall on deaf ears as both Rick and Jerry scream at it to go away. Dejected, the cat starts to cry and walks off into the desert. Rick erases Jerry's memories of the event. Later, the cat encountersBalthromawfrom earlier in the episode after he becomes tired of a man's company and roasts his car with fire. The dragon asks why it can speak, but the cat lowers its head and says the reason it can is shameful. After the dragon does not push the topic further, the cat asks how fast it can take them both to Florida. The Talking Cat resembles an ordinary gray tabby cat with a white belly, markings, and paws. He has yellow-green sclera and two light-colored whiskers on either side of his face. It is the physical incarnation of Disgust."

Truly, he was a \"new man\", no longer a macho couch potato but rather energetic and positive. Ute Uncle Barry then flew Rick and Morty to Bendigo, probably crossing dimensional borders in the process. As a man, Uncle Barry is a balding middle-aged caucasian man of giant size.

Initially planning on using Rhett Caan in his plan, Rick is forced to release him prematurely when confronted by theSelf-Referential Six. Rhett Caan then battles his captors himself; killing Connie TinuityError after retconning her weakness to be death by coffee, and retconning Mr. Twist to have been born without bones, before isolating the fortress and turning it into an orange. Due to his immense power of being able to \"retcon\" the attributes of nearly everything in existence, Rhett Caan sports a calm, confident, emotionless demeanor . He is quick to threaten Rick, a powerful individual in his own right, and has no qualms about cruelly dispatching his enemies by using creative albeit overly-cruel means. Rhett Caan is shown to be rather sadistic and ruthless to those who stand in his way, such as when he smirked while retconning Mr. Twist to be born without bones, which while not outright fatal, would have made whatever remained of Mr. Twist's life agonizing and difficult. Rickis implied to have met Rhett Caan in the past, where he knew of both his powers as well as where he was imprisoned. Despite Rhett's suggesting that Rick had always trusted him, the scientist is quick to refute the claim, and cautiously proposes the conditions of freeing him. Rhett then threatens Rick, but before the two could argue, they are confronted by theSelf-Referential Six. Rick then chooses to release Rhett prematurely rather than fight the Six, whereupon Caan leaves Rick and Morty alone and easily dispatches his captors. At some point in the past, Rhett Caan was captured and imprisoned by the Self-Referential Six, possibly due to his imperviousness to their powers as well as the extremely-threatening nature of his own powers. When freed by Rick, Rhett Caan wasted no time in brutally dispatching his former captors, outright killing Connie TinuityError before removing Mr. Twist's bones. He then isolates the fortress to prevent their escape, before retconning it into an orange. It is unknown what he does to the surviving members after Rick and Morty flee."

The Meeseeks appear in the fifth episode of the first season, \"Meeseeks and Destroy\" as the titular main antagonists. They are known to inhabit planets across the universe.[1][2] Meeseeks are creatures who are created to serve a singular purpose for which they will go to any length to fulfill. After they serve their purpose, they expire and vanish into the air. Their motivation to help others comes from the fact that existence is painful to a Meeseeks, and the only way to be removed from existence is to complete the task they were called to perform. Physical violence or damage cannot eliminate them, with multiple Meeseeks in the episode sustaining severe head trauma (to the point of having entire sections of their heads caved in and their eyes popping out of their sockets) or bodily mutilation (limbs ripped off, bones broken, multiple lacerations, strangulation, severe blunt force trauma) while still being fully conscious and physically functioning. The first Meeseeks spawned attributed this invulnerability to their being unable to die until their purpose is fulfilled, whether this means it is physically impossible to kill a Meeseeks or whether they simply didn't have the means on Earth to cause enough damage to their bodies that there wouldn't be anything left to function is unclear. They typically live for no more than a few hours, and thus two days is an eternity for Meeseeks. The longer the Meeseeks stay alive, the more sanity they begin to lose.Rickwarns the Smith family to keep their tasks simple. If a Meeseeks is not given a purpose at the beginning of its existence it seems to default to taking the purpose of the Meeseeks before it. This was seen when a Meeseeks created for Jerry created another Meeseeks then ordered it to kill another Meeseeks it was in an argument with which the resultant Meeseeks attempted to no avail. The Meeseeks then wildly began pressing the box without giving orders and all the resulting Meeseeks began trying in vain to kill the rest of the Meeseeks. Additionally, a Meeseeks can be persuaded to shift their purpose, as seen when the Meeseeks who were purposed to either helpJerryor kill the other Meeseeks were convinced by one to find and kill Jerry."

President Curtis is shown to be a domineering, sexist and very haughty authoritative figure. He holds the United States (which he considers the entire world) and his presidency in the highest regard and believes that \"the office of the President can't co-exist with a living god that won't submit to it,\" these beliefs would later clash with Rick and Morty's autonomous nature. When the President learns that Rick and Morty are annoyed with his incessant demands for aid, and is casually told by them that when they save the world the United States just happens to be saved too, he is angered and outright begins to antagonize the two, trying and miserably failing to prove that the United States doesn't need them. This finally stops when the President falls for Rick's ruse as \"Fly Fishing Rick,\" an alternate dimension version of Rick who feigns obedience and compliance to him while promising to undo the damage that the \"other Rick\" caused. This also shows that the President is somewhat gullible, as he never once questions the possibility of Fly Fishing Rick being Rick in an obvious disguise."

Rick speaks in a rambling manner that is often interrupted by belching and gagging, again this is due to his drug and alcohol addiction. Rick was a genius scientist, capable of creating complex scientific inventions, including brain-enhancing helmets, dream-invading devices, portals to several different dimensions, and the world's first amusement park inside the body of a living human.

In the atmosphere of Earth, the Vindicators, minus Rick and Morty, unite to take out Doom-Nomitron. While Supernova suggests that they distract Doom-Nomitron so Lady Katana could enter his nasal passage and sever his neural center, the latter shoots it down because Doom-Nomitron's veins are made of titanium and she can only cut with katanas with more precision. Following a discussion of Lady Katana, Calypso, and Diablo Verde being around to add diversity to the team, the latter asks why Supernova cannot use her powers to crack Doom-Nomitron open. Alan reveals that Supernova is pregnant, meaning she is unable to use her full powers without hurting the baby. Alan brings up a point of leaving Rick to handle Doom-Nomitron by himself, but that irks Supernova as they are the Vindicators, and unlike Rick, they are heroes. Still, everyone, including a reluctant Alan, agree to let Rick handle Doom-Nomitron by himself. Supernova tries to protest this decision as it would leave Earth defenseless, but Crocubot discovers 4893 planets that are in distress. Following Supernova coughing up an ant, as part of her and Million Ants baby, she reluctantly agrees to leave Earth and help the planets in distress. View a full transcript of this episodehere."

Ball Fondlers is a show that features a very crude drawing of a man wearing headphones, an anthropomorphic crocodile with a lollipop in his mouth, an Amazonian woman holding an assault rifle, and a tall African-American man with two afro puffs. All four of these people are in the military and they go around world, fighting other people in wars, rescuing people and protecting their own land. Ball Fondlers first appeared in the episode \"Rixty Minutes\" as one of the many shows thatRickshowed the rest of the Smith family on their interdimensional television set. Rick was proud to introduce them to this show because he really loved this show and it was extremely popular in all sorts of different dimensions.SummerandMortyeventually became very intrigued and drawn in and eventually became huge fans of the show. Rick was briefly seen watching Ball Fondlers in the episode \"Something Ricked This Way Comes\", just before Summer came in to tell him about her break up withMr. Needfuland the loss of her job."

These lifeforms use kinetic devices, which were given to them by Rick, to produce electricity. Under the guise of \"waste power\", a majority of the energy produced is extracted by Rick to power his ship. The people of this world, including their president,Chris, consider Rick to be a benevolent alien, when in fact, he is using them as slaves. Trouble occurs when a scientist in this miniature world,Zeep Xanflorp, invents his own Microverse Battery (which he calls a 'Miniverse') to provide his people with energy, thus making the kinetic devices Rick installed obsolete. Rick describes creating a \"spatially tessellated void inside a modified temporal field\", while Zeep Xanflorp describes his Miniverse as an \"unbounded vacuum inside a temporal field\". The temporal fields of the Miniverse and Teenyverse are known to speed up time inside the universes relative to the outside, but this is unclear in the case of the Microverse; hours pass for Summer in the car while Rick and Morty are inside the battery, but enough time apparently passes immediately after their escape for the Microverse to go back to Goobleboxes. The speed of time is at least slow enough for President Chris to have previously met Rick personally. Zeep Xanflorp states that 80% of the energy made by the inhabitants of his Miniverse is extracted for his use, while Rick does not state precisely how much of the Microverse's energy is extracted saying only that 'some of it' powers his ship. The Television broadcast in the Microverse world suggests that he is extracting about two thirds of the energy generated."

Rick pulls out a vial of Oxytocin extracted from avolewhich he mixes with one of Morty's hairs. He gives the potion to Morty with the instruction to smear it on whomever he wants to fall in love with him. Rick fails, however, to warn Morty of using it if Jessica has the flu. At theFlu Season DanceMorty successfully smears the potion onto Jessica's arm, making her fall in love with Morty and dumpBrad. Before Brad is taken away, he gets sneezed on by Jessica and also falls in love with Morty before himself sneezing into the punch bowl and into an air vent. Soon all attendees at the dance are madly in love with Morty. Rick saves Morty from the crowd of people and claims to be able to solve it all by releasing a solution made frompraying mantisDNA into the air. This only leads to further problems by turning all humans onEarthintoMantis-people. Rick makes a second antidote made from the DNA of all living things, but this makes the situation even worse than ever before as it neutralizes the love potion's effects, but turns everyone into horrible, ugly-looking mutants Rick dubsCronenbergs.

The goggles work by synching the user's eyes to the genetic code found across countless realities. When the user wears the goggles, they see their alternate dimension lives in the first-person. Later inRixty Minutes, Rick would lend the goggles toJerry,BethandSummer. The goggles allowed Jerry and Beth to see what would happen to them had they aborted Summer.

        "context": "Pocket Mortys PocketMortysBackground Pocket Mortys, also known asRick and Morty: Pocket Mortys, is aRick and Mortygame based on thePokémonvideo game series. It was slated to be released on January 14, 2016, but was released a day earlier. It has an official Discord Server which you can join byclicking here.[1] Throughout the game, the player controls Rick. The game starts in Rick's garage whenMysterious Rickenters through a portal and challenges the player to a Morty Battle. After defeating him, the player must exit through a portal that takes them to theCouncil of Ricks, where their portal gun is confiscated. To get it back, the player must defeat the six head Ricks. In order to fight them, the player must first fight Ricks from other dimensions and acquire their badges. After the player defeats them, the last council member turns out to be replaced by Mysterious Rick, who has captured the entire council. After the player defeats him, they will have the goal to catch (capture) each type of Morty. The concept of the game was taken from the popular \"Pokémon\" (Pocket Monstersin Japan) franchise. The object of the game is to collect Mortys, battle others (mainly Ricks), and earn badges. Considering that theRick and Mortyuniverse is an infinite multiverse,Justin Roilanddecided thatPocket Mortyscan be considered canon.[2]However, due toEvil Mortybeing added in the game, the game is technically non-canon, due to Evil Morty breaking through the Central Finite Curve in theSeason 5finale, “Rickmurai Jack”, and in the game, he appears in his spacesuit from the episode."

He wears a nightgown with a long, droopy hat with blue and white stripes and a white cotton ball at the end. He also wears a blue pajama robe. Sleepy Gary first appears in a memory planted byMr. Beauregard. In it, his \"father-in-law\"Rick, his \"daughter\"Summer, and Mr. Beauregard are having a pillow fight in Summer's room. Sleepy Gary barges in and berates them for being loud while he tries to sleep. He appears in every flashback afterwards. Gary proceeds to take Jerry's place in the minds of theSmith family, passing himself off as the husband ofBeth Smith, the lover ofJerry Smith, the father ofSummer SmithandMorty Smith, and the son-in-law ofRick Sanchez. When Rick accuses his granddaughter Summer of being a parasite, Gary intervenes and urges his \"father-in-law\" to remember the (fictional) barbecue that everyone in the family partook in. Rick begins to realize that Gary is aparasite, but is unable to fight the false memory of the barbecue, causing dozens of fake characters to spawn in theSmith houseat once. While Rick tries to sort out who is real and who isn't, Jerry takes Gary aside and expresses dismay over the possibility that, while Gary may be real, he is not. Gary immediately tries to assuage Jerry's fears, and \"reminds\" him of the vacation the two of them took, where they started their affair. The false memory causes Jerry to fall under the impression that he is Gary's lover. Gary tries to kiss Jerry, but the latter stops him and reminds him that they agreed to never do that \"in the house\"."

At some point after the separation, the female population created sex robots to mate with the male gazorpians in order to maintain the population. The male population regressed back to highly primitive state where they no longer wear any clothes or utilize an understandable language. The female population, on the other hand, continued to develop into a prosperous society. Somehow, one of theirsex robotsended up in apawn shopwhere it was bought byRick Sanchez. This would later lead Rick andSummer SmithtoGazorpazorpto learn more about Gazorpians. After first encountering the male population, they met the female population and were almost executed because of a really loud fart from Rick. In the episode, \"Morty's Mind Blowers\", a group of female Gazorpians can be seen captured, and contained, in the menagerie, right across fromRickandMorty. An alternate timeline exists where the Gazorpians never separated into ggroups depending on sex. In this timeline, the males did not regress into the primitive aggressive versions of themselves encountered by The Smiths. They createdGazorpazorpfield, a hit interdimensional TV-show[1]; andGazorpazorpazon, an intergalactic marketplace and warehouse chain. The manager of one such warehouse was interviewed on the intergalactic radio podcast1% Visible."

He is also holding the skull the shape of a Morty, presumably his Morty that had died on one of their adventures. Guilt ridden, this Rick now carries the skull of his Morty wherever he goes. Guilty Rick is thought to be the maker of the Test X1, Test X46 and Test X72 Mortys found in the game, since the descriptions of the Mortys show that they were made by \"A guilt ridden Rick trying to bring back his lost grandson\". Guilty Rick also says that he has \"Seen things, terrible, Morty related things\" and that his \"Mortys will go down with the truth and I shall never speak of it\". This shows that Guilty Ricks Mortys knew his original Morty, and most likely know how they died, hinting that Guilty Rick's original Morty died while fighting against other Mortys. The descriptions of the Test Mortys says that their Ricks spent their 'dying days' making them, and since Guilty Rick is still alive, this goes against the theory of the test Mortys being Guilty Ricks creations."

The IDEA had found Rick's location after they captured one of his Meeseeks, which he used to distribute his drugs without being traced. After they had surrounded Rick's hideout, Rurtaugh and another Gromflomite brought forth a battering ram to break down Rick's door. Rick used hisMeeseeks Boxto create a huge group of meeseeks to fight off the gromflomites while he,MortyandSummerran off. Rurtaugh was killed by a Meeseek using a rope in the commotion. Rurtaugh was obviously a very skillful IDEA agent seeing as he was sent to ram down Rick Sanchez's door, effectively putting him in the first line of duty against the drug lord. He was, however, taken by the horde of meeseeks who stormed out Rick's hideout to kill everyone. Rurtaugh was also a loving gromflomite, dedicating his last words to request for someone to tell his wife that he loved her."

The laser gun was first used at the end of the episode \"Meeseeks and Destroy\" where he used it to killMr. Jellybeanbefore leaving his dimension, knowing he tried to rape his grandsonMorty, after being told by Morty himself. It appeared again, in the episode \"Raising Gazorpazorp.\" However, in this episode, instead of it firing its usual red bolts, it fired blue bolts. He used this weapon to kill a group of male Gazorpians that had capturedSummeronGazorpazorp, then force them to collect sex robots for parts to fix his broken portal gun while protecting Summer from their advances."

He has spiky hair on his head and a unibrow. His face is wrinkly as he had bags under his eyelids and a pressure fold above his unibrow that follows its position and laugh lines on both sides of his mouth. He wears a white lab coat with a light blue green shirt underneath. He also wears brown pants, a dark brown belt with a yellow buckle, and black shoes. Rick speaks in a rambling manner that is often interrupted by belching and gagging, again this is due to his drug and alcohol addiction. Despite the lack of a divorce betweenJerryandBeththere doesn't seem to be a major difference with the personality ofRickduring the first 2 seasons, although unlike the main Rick he never got a major character development, if not directly being worsened by the time exposed to the matrimonial problems of his daughter.

When he came toDimension C-137,his counterpartrejected the offer. Insulted, Prime sent a bomb to Dimension C-137, killing its versions ofDianeandBeth. After grieving for some time, Rick C-137 built his own Portal Gun, the only Rick other than Prime to actually invent the device[2]and began hunting Rick Prime. It is an amazing gun, but has its limits. Only mass heavier than air may pass through the portal. In earlier episodes, it appears to be powered by some type of green plasma ball inside of the dome shaped glass vial on the top of the device. In later episodes, we learn the portal gun utilizes a special fluid that Rick calls \"Quantum Transport Solution\" inForgetting Sarick Mortshall. In the same episode, we learn fromMortythat Portal Fluid is made from rare green-glowing crystals that Rick buys illegally. InThe Ricklantis Mixup, we learn that Portal Fluid is restricted on the Citadel of Ricks, which led to the rise of \"Bootleg Portal Fluid\" that when made correctly, will likely act the same way as real Portal fluid. However, when Bootleg Portal Fluid is made incorrectly (Such as by messing up the math involved) it can have disastrous effects. This is seen inThe Ricklantis Mixupwhen a Rick making Bootleg Portal Fluid gets busted and attempts to use his portal gun to escape a Police Rick and Morty, which results in him dissolving upon contact with the portal he made, likely killing him, to which Police Morty responds to by saying \"I guess his math was off\"."

The history of the species is largely unknown, but they appear to have established or otherwise obtained control of the Galactic Federation at some point. Gromflomites are shown to comprise the entire upper echelon of the Galactic Federal government, as well as most of their military, the latter referred to as the Galactic Militia. At least one Gromflomite,Krombopulos Michael, has taken on jobs that sometimes require action against the Federation, including the killing of Federation-aligned Gromflomite guards, suggesting that the species as a whole may not be loyal to the Federation. The majority of Gromflomites depicted on the show happen to be soldiers, but they are otherwise not implied to be a wholly militaristic society, with civilian Gromflomites making some appearances. The Gromflomites are insectoid creatures, sporting many features similar to common flies and praying mantises. Their bodies are a dull green color, darker in some places and lighter in others and covered in small bumps or hairs. Their midsections are conical in shape, being larger around the head and smaller around the legs. The Gromflomites' heads are typically much smaller than their upper bodies, with large, red compound-eyes and two small antennae sticking out the top, with mouths consisting of sagging vertical lips. Gromflomites do not seem to blink, but their eyes still feature a pair of eyelids used to display emotions and can visibly perspirate in stressful situations. The color of their blood is dark blue. Gromflomites have two thin arms which get thicker and gain edges starting at the elbows, ending in a variable amount of articulated pincers used as fingers. There are four udder-like appendages sticking out of their chests and two more from their groins. We know that at least the groin ones serves as shell glands or gonads.[1]They are capable of asexual reproduction[2]however still often seem to form human-like family units, with many Gromflomites mentioning significant others or multiple parents. The Gromflomites' legs are thin and triple-jointed, with each ending in a foot with two large claws in front and a much shorter one sticking out of the ankle."

        "context": "Rick and Morty Issue 1 Cover A Sitting at the table with the rest of his family, Jerry tells Morty that he needs to get a job in order to support himself, on the grounds that Jerry himself worked several jobs as a teenager while going to school. Rick contradicts his argument by calling Jerry a debt-choked idiot and dragging Morty off to the garage, telling Jerry that he is going to show Morty \"how smart people make money.\" While Morty says he can hear Jerry crying in the dining room, Rick unlocks the door to the garage, asking Morty if he knows anything about the stock market; he begins searching for something in a bin filled with random objects. Morty supplies a fairly accurate description of what the stock market does, but Rick disregards it and pushes a small device into Morty's hands. He claims it is capable of predicting the future, which will allow them to play the stock market successfully and make \"more money than we could spend in a lifetime\". Morty questions the morality and legality of such a device, but Rick says that it is perfectly legal and that all Morty must do is put his name, rather than Rick's, on the forms; Rick himself will handle the other details. Arriving at the International Stock Exchange, Rick tells Morty to stay close to him and follow his instructions; \"Technically speaking,\" he says, \"I'm not allowed inside this building.\" Morty's complaint about Rick's having lied to him about the situation are quashed by Rick, who accuses Morty of being unwilling to break rules. Their argument is broken up by the appearance of Professor Tock, a \"time detective\" in a multicolored plaid suit who knows Rick by name. After introducing himself to Morty and being mocked mercilessly by Rick, Tock states that Rick should not be here, and implies that he knows why Rick has come to the Exchange. Rick angrily contradicts this assertion, saying that Tock cannot possibly know the reason for his visit \"because time travel doesn't make sense!\" He also calls it \"a paradox\" and \"impossible garbage science\". He also states that if Tock was truly aware of his reasons, he would \"arrest him already\". Tock implies this statement to be a partial self-incrimination of wrongdoing, and Rick storms off, taking Morty with him and threatening to assault Tock over his time-based puns. Walking away, Morty tells Rick that Tock seemed like alright to him, to which Rick, in a fit of suspicion and anger, threatens Morty, accusing him of wearing a wire and selling out his family. When Morty, terrified, asserts he is not wearing a wire, however, Rick immediately relents and walks away, telling Morty that they have to register him before the offices close. After getting in line, Rick tells him that Morty needs to pass a \"quantum DNA scan\", which will ensure that he is registering in his own timeline; after this, they will be able to do everything else from home. Morty is hesitant, having encountered Tock and having heard Rick himself say that time travel is impossible, but Rick assures him that Morty needs to do this to assert his dominance over Jerry. As the teller calls them to her window, Tock watches them from a dark corner. Some time afterward, Rick and Morty's ploy has run successfully, and they are in the process of adding a $10 million, glass-and-concrete annex onto the house; it bears the name \"Morty & Rick, Inc.\" The construction noise is greatly upsetting Jerry, who decides to confront Morty about it. As he passes the front door, he hears a knock; opening the door, he finds a crate, out of which bursts a mechanical, bipedal cat. Believing it to be dangerous, Jerry curls into the fetal position and begs it to take his children and belongings (he gives it the location and combination of his safe). The robot is harmless, however, and as it mounts the stairs, Rick walks through the front door; he has heard Jerry's panic-driven admissions, but he passes on insulting Jerry's cowardice, saying that \"living as you is punishment enough. That was dark, man. Real dark.\" As he walks up the stairs, telling Jerry that he has \"another billion dollars or whatever\" to make, Jerry asks if admitting that his demands that Morty get a job were wrong would be sufficient to convince Rick to call off the moneymaking operation; Rick simply answers, \"I'll think about it,\" before leaving Jerry by himself. Tock then appears at the door, making another time pun and telling Jerry that, as their problems stem from the same source, they have the ability to help solve both of their problems."

Evil Morty's portal gun is very similar in appearance to a regular portal gun, with a black dial to select a destination and a red LED display. However, unlike a regular portal gun, this variant is coated with a reflective gold plating and sports a less streamlined housing. The fluid reservoir and subsequently generated portals appear to be golden as well. After Evil Morty successfully managed to break through the Central Finite Curve's surrounding \"wall\" and accessed the edge of themultiverse, he used his portal gun to open a portal to an unknown location. The device has been in Evil Morty's possession for an undisclosed period, though one could assume it has been operational for some time beforeRickandMorty'simpromptu arrival toRe-Build-A-Morty. When Evil Morty found his refuge disturbed by Rick's fracking of the Central Finite Curve to findRick Prime, he returned to confront Rick and Morty. When Evil Morty's advice led to the three finding a trap decoy of Prime, Evil Morty tried to portal away only for Prime's black portal fluid to collapse Evil Morty's portal. After three had survived Prime's trap, both Rick and Evil Morty found that their Portal Guns unable to function. Taking the gun, Rick combined it with his own, along with some cybernetics fromNerd Rickand Prime's Portal Fluid, to escape back to theParmesan dimension. After Rick used Prime's portal fluid to discover his nemesis's location, Evil Morty used the same portal fluid as a means to follow.

This is not a fully consistent system but can allow a viewer to generally discern the portal type according to the colour of said portal. The following list represents a simplified categorisation of portals purely based on colour. The below sections will go into greater detail about specific types of portals. Interspatial Portals: which seem to appear blue (\"Pilot\" & \"The Rickshank Rickdemption\") allow teleportation between two fixed points within the origin universe. It is inferred that properly functioning blue portals have no significant time discrepancy (enabling nearly instantaneous transportation) when used."

Morty goes outside to find Rick yelling at him to get in the car. Despite Morty wanting to sleep in, he comes with Rick anyway. Beth and Summer try to stop Rick from bringing Morty with him, but to no avail. On the road, Rick tells Morty they are going toBendigoto get his green cube, and shows him a portal gun that he modified into a real gun. He then attempts to kill Morty, due to his constant whining and complaining, and when he kills Morty, he’ll drive the car off the cliff and then kill himself. But first, they go to the gas station."

Bushworld Adventures Rick displays downright psychopathic tendencies, even killing the store clerk after getting gas, not long after going on an entire spiel on how he was going to kill Morty and then himself. He also completely forgets the reason they went on the initial 8 hour drive during the end of the short. He seems to be good friends withJerry Smithin which they work together to play a prank on Morty. Bushworld Adventures Rick and Morty seem to have a similar relationship toRick SanchezandMorty Smith.  Although Bushworld Adventures Rick is a lot more violent to Morty and outright threatens murder."
